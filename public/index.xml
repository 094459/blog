Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, and serverless time series database service perfect for use cases that generate huge amounts of events per day, optimised to make it faster and more cost effective that using relational databases.
I have been playing around with Amazon Timestream to prepare for a talk I am doing with some colleagues, and wanted to see how I could integrate it with other AWS services in the context of leveraging some of the key capabilities of Amazon Timestream.</description>

      <description>Reading and writing data across different AWS accounts in you Apache Airflow DAGs
As regular readers will know, I sometimes lurk in the Apache Airflow slack channel to see what is going on. If you are new to Apache Airflow, or want to get a deeper understanding then I highly recommend spending some time here. The community is super welcoming and eager to help new participants.
It was during a recent session I came across an interesting problem that one of the builders was having, which was how to access (read/write) data in an S3 bucket which was in a different account to the one hosting Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA).</description>

      <description>Maximising the re-use of your DAGs in MWAA
During some recently conversations with customers, one of the topics that they were interested in was how to create re-usable, parameterised Apache Airflow workflows (DAGs) that could be executed dynamically through the use variables and/or parameters (either submitted via the UI or the command line). This makes a lot of sense, as you may find that you repeat similar tasks in your workflows, and so this approach allows you to maximise the re-use of that work.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Apache Airflow slack channel is a vibrant community of open source builders that is a great source of feedback, knowledge and answers to problems and use cases you might have when trying to do stuff with Apache Airflow. This week I picked up on someone seeing errors with Amazon EKS, and so I thought what better time to try out the new Apache Airflow 2.x version that was recently launched in Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA).</description>

      <description>Introduction Inspired by a recent conversation within the Apache Airflow open source slack community, I decided to channel the inner terrier within me to tackle this particular issue, around getting an Apache Airflow operator (the protagonist for this post) to work.
I found the perfect catalyst in the way of the original launch post of Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). As is often the way, diving into that post (creating a workflow to take some source files, transform them and then move them into Amazon Redshift) led me down some unexpected paths to here, this post.</description>

      <description>update: I have changed the post to use standard Apache Airflow variables rather than using AWS Secrets Manager.
Part One - Automating Amazon Athena As part of an upcoming DevDay event, I have been working on how you can use Apache Airflow to help automate your Extract, Load and Transform (ELT) Workflows. Amazon Athena and Amazon EMR are two AWS services that help customers who have existing SQL skills/expertise and are looking at tools such as Presto or Apache Hive when undertaking those transformations.</description>

In addition to that news, we have some interesting projects for builders interested in infrastructure as code, a couple of great benchmarking posts, including another great AWS Graviton2 story and my new favourite open source project, Apache Airflow.</description>

      <description>Today I was setting up an application load balancer that sits in front of a test application I have put together. Setting this up was super easy, and very quickly I had my domain pointing to the alias and serving requests.
As part of the setup, I wanted to monitor the application load balancer to let me know when requests were failing to the downstream application (anything other than an HTTP 200) and so I set this up super easily in Amazon Cloudwatch.</description>

As 2020 comes to a close, and you reflect on how your year has been it is often a good opportunity to take a look about your year ahead and possibly start to explore new opportunities or your next challenge.
As you think about next year and where you want to go, I wanted to share an exciting opportunity that has opened up in my team, the UK Developer Advocate team.</description>

      <guid>https://example.com/2020-10-15_amazon-aurora-setting-up-and-configuration-four-ways/</guid>
      <description>In this post I want to share four different approaches to installing and configuring your Amazon Aurora database clusters.
Everything in this post is covered in detail in the embedded video, but I wanted to share some additional information that I did not include in the video that was easier done in this blog.
{% youtube wZfh9PurE9E %}
Why four ways? The approach in the video was to look at the journey you might take when learning a new technology and then how you move to productise that technology.</description>

      <description>October 12th - Instalment #39 Week No.39 - The 39 Steps is a pretty famous film, a spy thriller if you are into those types of films and I recently found out that the name came from a location not too far from me. I am pleased to say that episode 39 of this newsletter is equally thrilling, combining the usual mix of new open source projects (including one so fresh, it is still warm to the touch), blog posts, case studies and events for you to check out.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was looking to import the TPC-H dataset (some 600 or so million rows) into Amazon Aurora from a workstation that I connect to using AWS Session Manager.
AWS Session Manager is a great way to simplify your life by allowing you to connect to a machine via the AWS console and not worry about having to manage ssh keys or remembering to lock down external public access from the net.</description>

      <description>Over the past 20 years I have spent a significant amount of time doing all kinds of benchmarking tests. This week I was looking to kick the tyres of Amazon Aurora, and explore the performance gains that can be had using some of the features that customers can use, such as parallel query. I was looking to reproduce some of the findings of this blog post from Jeff Barr.
To do that, I needed to setup some benchmarking tools, and for databases there are plenty out there.</description>

      <description>In this podcast I speak with Justin Garrison, Developer Advocate in the Containers team at AWS, and ask him about his journey in open source.
From user to contributor
According to PwC&amp;rsquo;s annual CEO Survey (which you can find easily enough via your preferred search tool), one of the top challenges keeping CEO&amp;rsquo;s up at night is how to tackle their digital skills shortage. In fact, 74% were concerned about the availability of key skills.</description>

      <description>According to a number of recent studies, the use and adoption of open source software continues to rise. From studies such as the State of Enterprise Open Source by Red Hat (in which nearly 70% of respondents stated that open source software is either extremely or very important) or TideLift’s April 2019 survey report (that found more than 90% of professional developers use open source in building their applications) it is clear that developers from startups to highly regulated enterprises have embraced open source solutions.</description>

I am currently putting together some stats that I will share with you around the breakdown of various open source topics I have seen over that time. Watch this space.
This week I have added a Retro section as one of the things that keeps coming up is cool open source projects that are not new, but I had never heard of before and are getting new contributions or releases.</description>

This means that you should refer to the project home page https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync and check out the README.md for what changes you might need to make to get this tool working.
 Next level ssosync In a previous post, I talked about setting up AWS Single Sign On (AWS SSO) with G-Suite, and then using an open source project called ssosync to syncronise users and groups from G-Suite into AWS SSO.</description>

      <description>update-July 28th  The ssosync tool has had a lot of interest and the community has updated the tool. This means that you should refer to the project home page https://github.com/awslabs/ssosync and check out the README.md for what changes you might need to make to get this tool working.
 Enabling AWS SSO with Google G-Suite Many customers have existing directory technologies where they manage their users, and then use this central identity store as a way to simplify the way they authenticate and provide access to applications and other resources.</description>

      <description>May 18th - Instalment #20 Episode 20, another packed episode with plenty to check out, and some really great announcements and projects to share. With that, let&amp;rsquo;s get started with one of our big announcements last week.

The big news this week though was the launch of CDK for Kubernetes, an open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages and rich object-oriented APIs.</description>

      <description>May 11th - Instalment #19 Episode 19, and this week&amp;rsquo;s edition is bursting at the seams with probably the biggest amount of news and updates to share (hence the later posting). Looks like everyone has been busy, and there were some things I had to leave out for another time.
Before I get started though, I think it is worth reflecting on this blog post by Matt Asay, The most important part of an open source project, where he talks about the value of all contributions in open source projects, not just the developers cutting code.</description>

It is not intended to be right or wrong, but just my personal opinion and experience and I hope it is read that way. I have put this together to share what I think are the critical things that make a mentoring relationship work for both the mentor and mentee.

      <description>May 4th - Instalment #18 Episode 18, is the open source Force strong in you?
A post from colleague Matt Asay this week, Remembering when open source is fun made me think about the first open source projects I got my hands on (Apache httpd server, back in 1998). Good times indeed, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until later that I did my first contribution (a security module for Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s Confluence to enable SSO).</description>

      <description>April 6th - Instalment #14 Episode 14, and yet more abundance of open source to share with you. Fourteen is an interesting number, and very quickly googling this, I learnt that the number fourteen has a number of interesting facts: the moon waxes for fourteen days and then wanes for fourteen days, a golf player can have no more than fourteen clubs in their caddy, it is the atomic number for silicon and for those who enjoy their open source with the literature, 14 is also the number of lines in a sonnet.</description>

      <description>March 30th - Instalment #13 Episode 13, lucky for some, superstitious for others. I can promise you no superstitious when you read this, nothing but the finest open source news and updates from around the globe and hopefully a few projects that you will find useful. First though, let us celebrate those people that without them, this newsletter would be just an empty vessel. Interesting to see a higher than normal number of new projects and first time projects this week which is awesome.</description>

      <description>March 9th - Instalment #10 Another bumper packed edition of everything new and interesting in the world where open source and AWS comingle. I have been asked a few times as to how do I choose the articles that go into these posts, so I thought I would very quickly share that; what does and does not go into these posts.
The idea of this series is to provide a curated list of open source projects that are either created by AWS, by the builders within AWS and open source projects that are created by customers and builders that either help other customers use AWS services and open source projects.</description>

      <description>With still so much to digest post FOSDEM, SustainOSS and CHAOSS, this weeks updates are a little more lightweight and easy to consume. I am going to work on some tutorials/coding posts so would be interested (use comments) on what open source AWS projects you would like to see material on.
Modernising with open source Following on from the previous post on the essential open source tools for serverless, I came across this blog post by Matt Billock called &amp;ldquo;Essential Open Source Serverless Tools&amp;rdquo; - it is a great reference guide, so check it out.</description>

      <description>As I reflect on 2019, one of the common themes whilst engaging with builders at the start of their career, has been how do those of us who have deep experience working in the IT industry and technology help bring those who are just starting out?
Some common themes when talking that have come up include;
 How do I get started on Cloud or AWS? What tools and languages should I learn?</description>

      <description>As it is the time of year that many are now beginning to reflect on where they have been and what they have achieved and look towards the future. For some this might mean looking for new opportunities and so I wanted to share some thoughts I had on this based on my own experience as well as the experience from mentoring others, that I hope will be helpful as you look to deciding what your new year might look like.</description>

      <description>So, with reInvent drawing to close and many of the attendees recovering from the after party (re:Play), I thought I would put together a curated list of the open source sessions that have been running this week.
We had a great variety of open source sessions, covering topics from data and data analytics to robotics. If you missed these sessions, you can check out the videos in this post below. They are sorted by category to help you find those that are of most interest to you.</description>

      <description>On October 17th we have a free, online event covering several tracks on Machine Learning. Whether you are a complete beginner or seasoned data scientist, we have gentle introductions to deep dives.
What I am most excited about however, is that we will have an AWS DeepRacer racing challenge. You will learn how to create your first reinforcement learning model that will race a virtual car, with prizes for the fastest times.</description>
