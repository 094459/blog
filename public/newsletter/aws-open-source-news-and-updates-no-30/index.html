<p><strong>CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-cis-amazon-eks-benchmark/">Introducing The CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark</a> - last week I shared a short video from Aqua Security&rsquo;s Liz Rice showing kube-bench (video is also included in this post). This week we have a post from Paavan Mistry and Michael Hausenblas that talks about a new Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). This new benchmark is optimised to help you accurately assess the security configuration of Amazon EKS clusters, including security assessments for nodes to help meet security and compliance requirements. You can use the CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark to accurately assess the security configuration of Amazon EKS cluster nodes. As a bonus, they also include links to other CIS benchmark resources for web frameworks and Amazon Linux/Amazon Linux2.</p>
<p><strong>AWS SAM CLI</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/the-aws-serverless-application-model-cli-is-now-generally-available/">The AWS Serverless Application Model CLI is now generally available</a> -  Eric Johnson writes about the recent GA of the AWS SAM CLI, something I covered last week. The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) is an open-source framework for building serverless applications. Built on AWS CloudFormation, AWS SAM provides shorthand syntax to declare serverless resources. During deployment, AWS SAM transforms the serverless resources into CloudFormation syntax, enabling you to build serverless applications faster. As a companion to AWS SAM, the AWS SAM CLI is a command line tool that operates on AWS SAM templates. It provides developers local tooling to create, develop, debug, and deploy serverless applications and offers a rich set of tools that enable developers to build serverless applications quickly.The post walks you through how to use this.</p>

<p><strong>Liberty IT</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/liberty-it-adopts-serverless-best-practices-using-aws-cdk/">Liberty IT Adopts Serverless Best Practices Using AWS Cloud Development Kit</a> - Matthew Coulter, Lead Technical Architect of Global Risk at Liberty Mutual provides a run down over how Liberty took the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), the AWS Well-Architected framework, and the Serverless Application Lens for the AWS Well-Architected Framework and built a set of CDK patterns in to help developers launch serverless resources. I shared Matt&rsquo;s post last week (<a href="https://dev.to/nideveloper/cdk-patterns-at-20-let-s-walk-through-all-20-serverless-patterns-for-aws-d1n">here</a>) which is worth reading again. This is a great effort and provides organisations with a way to accelerate their teams building consistent, bar raising infrastructure to support their applications.</p>
<p><strong>Halter and the Cow Collar</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/the-cow-collar-wearable-how-halter-benefits-from-freertos/">The Cow Collar Wearable: How Halter benefits from FreeRTOS</a> - Tanmoy Sen and Arun Viswanathan have put this post that appeals to my farming roots back in Galicia (dairy farming and potatoes!). Halter is an agri-tech original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that focuses on cattle herd management. Halter creates GPS enabled, solar powered smart collars for cows. The collar hardware allows farmers to interact with an easy-to-use app to remotely set geographic boundaries for cattle or virtual fences. Farmers use Halter’s system to avoid physically herding cows, maximizing farmer time and productivity.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/how-caresyntax-uses-managed-database-services-for-better-surgical-outcomes/">How caresyntax uses managed database services for better surgical outcomes</a> -  guest post from Ken Wu, Chief Technology Officer, and Steve Gordon, Director of Engineering at caresyntax, and looks how they combine both managed open source services from AWS, native AWS services and open source projects such as Redis to create Periop Insight, which is a surgical data analytics solution for today’s busy preoperative leaders to improve their operating room (OR) performance. It is an enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) web application that works on desktops, tablets, and phone form factors. Although many modern data-centric applications deal with extremely large volumes of data, Periop Insight’s challenges stemmed from the complexity of the data, not volume. This is a fascinating read, so check it out.</p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon Elasticsearch</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Elasticsearch Service now supports open source Elasticsearch 7.7 and its corresponding version of Kibana. This minor release includes bug fixes and enhancements. This release improves cluster stability by significantly reducing the amount of heap memory that is needed to keep Lucene segments open. It also delivers faster results when querying time-based indices by filtering out shards that do not contain documents with relevant timestamps. We also added support for regular expressions in Painless scripts.</p>
<p>Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains running Elasticsearch 7.7 include support for recently released features like custom dictionaries, UltraWarm, and cross-cluster search. The release also includes support for features like anomaly detection, and SQL Workbench that are components of Open Distro for Elasticsearch, an Apache 2.0-licensed distribution of Elasticsearch.</p>
<p><strong>CIS Benchmark for Amazon EKS</strong></p>
<p>The new CIS Benchmark for Amazon EKS helps you accurately assess the secure configuration of nodes running as part of your Amazon EKS clusters.</p>
<p>Security is a critical consideration for configuring and maintaining Kubernetes clusters and applications. <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/">The Center for Internete Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark</a> provides good practice guidance on security configurations for self-managed Kubernetes clusters, but did not accurately help evaluate the security configuration status for the AWS-managed Kubernetes clusters run by Amazon EKS. Not all of the recommendations from the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark were applicable to EKS clusters as customers are not responsible for configuring or managing the control plane.</p>
<p>Now, the CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark provides accurate guidance for node security configurations for EKS. The benchmark is applicable to EC2 nodes (both managed and self-managed) where you are responsible for security configurations of Kubernetes components. The benchmark provides a standard, community-approved way to ensure that you have configured your Kubernetes cluster and nodes securely when using Amazon EKS.</p>
<p>The CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark consists of four sections; control plane logging configuration, node security configurations, policies, and managed services. The benchmark supports the Kubernetes versions currently available from Amazon EKS (v1.15 - v1.17) and can be run using kube-bench, a standard open source tool for checking configuration using the CIS benchmark on Kubernetes clusters.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI now GA</strong></p>
<p>The AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is now generally available. SAM CLI is a deployment toolkit that also allows you to locally build, test, and debug serverless applications. SAM CLI v.1.0.0 is a stable version recommended for building production serverless applications.</p>
<p>Previously, SAM CLI was available in beta, supported by the docker-lambda emulation images developed by Michael Hart (AWS Serverless Hero). Now, v1.0.0 is supported by AWS provided emulation images. This version also includes new build support for custom AWS Lambda runtimes and AWS Lambda Layers.</p>
<p>SAM CLI enables you to easily build serverless applications using a number of commands, including sam init, sam build, and sam deploy. Using sam build, you can compile your application code and dependencies. To compile Custom AWS Lambda runtimes and AWS Lambda Layers, you can include the BuildMethod property in your SAM template under the function or layer resource. The BuildMethod is either an AWS Lambda runtime or Makefile, which defines a set of tasks to be executed.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EFS CSI driver no GA</strong></p>
<p>The Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) CSI driver is now generally available. The EFS CSI driver makes it simple to configure elastic file storage for both EKS and self-managed Kubernetes clusters running on AWS using standard Kubernetes interfaces. Applications running in Kubernetes can use EFS file systems to share data between pods in a scale-out group, or with other applications running within or outside of Kubernetes. EFS can also help Kubernetes applications be highly available because all data written to EFS is written to multiple AWS Availability zones. If a Kubernetes pod is terminated and relaunched, the CSI driver will reconnect the EFS file system, even if the pod is relaunched in a different AWS Availability Zone.</p>
<p>With the 1.0 release, the EFS CSI driver now has in-transit encryption enabled by default, helping companies meet their security and compliance goals. Additionally, the driver now supports EFS Access Points, application-specific entry points into an EFS file system that make it easier to share a file system between multiple pods. Access points can enforce a user identity for all file system requests that are made through the access point, and enforce a root directory for each pod.</p>
