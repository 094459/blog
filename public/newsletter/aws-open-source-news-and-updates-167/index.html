  <title>AWS open source newsletter #167 | Beachgeek blog - a refuge for pineapple on pizza lovers</title>

  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="AWS open source newsletter #167"/>
<meta name="twitter:description" content="July 31st, 2023 - Instalment #167 Welcome to #167 of the AWS open source newsletter, and another edition packed with new open source projects for you to explore. Whether you are new to this newsletter, or returning (we thank you!) there is something for you. This week we have projects that will help use Terraform to deploy your monolith applications, a tool to accelerate your GraphQL building when working with Amazon DynamoDB, a project that will help you introduce chaos without changes to your code, and a couple of really nice demos of using generative AI that allows you to use natural language to query your data."/>

<p><em>The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution. The projects mentioned here do not represent any formal recommendation or endorsement, I am just sharing for greater awareness as I think they look useful and interesting!</em></p>
<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p><strong>aws-terrajet</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/33b">aws-terrajet</a> is a project from Chuong Tran (Chris) that aide from having a really cool project name, aims to help Developers deploy their monolith application to AWS in the easiest and fastest way. From the README we can see that &ldquo;TerraJet follows AWS best practices to help your infrastructure archives reliability, security, performance, and cost optimisation&rdquo;. Certainly looks interesting, and got a lot of interest on Reddit.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/chuongtran27/aws-terrajet/blob/main/images/diagram.png?raw=true" alt="architecture of aws-terrajet"></p>
<p><strong>aws-dynasync</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/33c">aws-dynasync</a> is fresh from the open source forge at awslabs, and this project helps you create an AWS AppSync GraphQL API and an Amazon DynamoDB database with a single command. You can automate the building and provisioning of a GraphQL API using a single config file with AWS AppSync and Amazon DynamoDb to store the data. Nicely details documentation with examples means that if you are working in AWS AppSync and Amazon DynamoDB, you have to try this out.</p>
<p><strong>chaos-lambda-extension</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/33a">chaos-lambda-extension</a> AWS Hero Efi Merdler-Kravitz is back with another tool that allows you to inject faults into Lambda functions without modifying the function code. Unlike previous chaos implementations that required tight coupling with the Lambda runtime, this extension is runtime-agnostic. It can operate with any runtime that utilises Amazon Linux 2. The chaos extension is publicly available as a layer and you can easily incorporate the layer using the AWS Console, or your preferred IAC solution. Efi is on a mission to create Rust based tools that help AWS developers, so check this out and let him know what you think. Efi reach out and added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Rust-written Lambda extension that introduces chaos, but here&rsquo;s the kicker – no code changes needed. It&rsquo;s a bit of a game-changer compared to other chaos utilities for Lambda.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, Efi is looking for your feedback. He told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been diving deep into Rust to boost the performance of some AWS CLI tools. I&rsquo;m on the lookout for tools in the AWS ecosystem that might either need a revamp or simply don&rsquo;t exist yet but could greatly benefit from that Rust speed magic. Got any pain points or gaps you&rsquo;ve noticed that I might tackle? I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>guidance-for-natural-language-queries-of-relational-databases-on-aws</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/337">guidance-for-natural-language-queries-of-relational-databases-on-aws</a> demonstrates how to build an application enabling users to ask questions directly of relational databases using natural language queries (NLQ). The architecture uses LangChain’s SQL Database Chain, a Streamlit framework, and an Amazon SageMaker JumpStart Foundation Model (FM). With this Guidance, your NLQ will be converted into a natural language answer as part of the NLQ process. After submitting the converted SQL query and compiling the results, the results will be converted using generative artificial intelligence (AI) into a text explanation written in NLQ. The translation from SQL to NLQ is supported by a foundation model (FM) that translates the natural language question to SQL and back to a natural language answer. Gary Stafford who features regularly in this newsletter, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This solution is first in a set of Generative AI Guidance from AWS to help our customers accelerate development of Generative AI use cases on AWS. Natural Language Query (NLQ) of structured data in relational, NoSQL, timeseries, and graph databases is of huge industry interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>llm-langchain-sql-demo</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/338">llm-langchain-sql-demo</a> this repo provides code to enable you to follow along in the excellent post from colleague and regular face within this newsletter, Gary Stafford. In <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/339">Generative AI for Analytics: Performing Natural Language Queries on Amazon RDS using SageMaker, LangChain, and LLMs</a>, Gary shows you how you can use LangChain’s SQL Database Chain and Agent with large language models to perform natural language queries (NLQ) of Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL database. You will need access to OpenAI and Anthropic API keys to use this code.</p>
<h3 id="aws-and-community-blog-posts">AWS and Community blog posts</h3>
<p><strong>Community round up</strong></p>
<p>Lots of really interesting content from the AWS Community this week, but starting us off is AWS Community Builder Sreekesh Iyer with his post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/333">Self Hosting Supabase on AWS</a>. <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/334">Supabase</a> is a well loved open source backend as a service that allows web and app developers to simplify common functionality they need (authentication and authorisation, storage, API generation, etc), and in this post Sreekesh provides a quick guide to get this up and running in your AWS environment so you can try it out for yourself. I somehow missed this post when it first came out, but AWS Hero Efi Merdler-Kravitz put together <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/332">Migrating a Web App to AWS Lambda with Lambda Web Adapter</a> that looked at how to use a project featured in <a href="https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-146-26bh">#146</a> of this newsletter, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2jv">aws-lambda-web-adapter</a>, to migrate a sample web application. If you missed this project the first time, read Efi&rsquo;s post and check out the project, it is super interesting. Vector databases and Large Language Models (LLMs) are everywhere it seems, so it is handy that AWS Community Builder Dejanu Alex has put together <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/335">OpenSearch as Vector DB: Supercharge Your LLM</a>, which provides a quick post on how Amazon OpenSearch can help you as well as showing you how to get this up and running. To finish up this Community roundup we have a regular face, AWS Community Builder Lars Jacobsson. He is back with a blog post this time, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/336">Introducing samp-cli for local Lambda debugging of SAM and CDK stacks</a> looking at how one of this projects can help you dear developer, to improve the local developer experience when using AWS SAM and CDK.

<p><strong>Powertools for AWS Lambda</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are new to Powertools for AWS Lambda, or a seasoned user, Mark Sailes <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32x">tweeted</a> last week details about the <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32y">Discord server</a> that you should join in order to meet the broader Powertools community and stay up to date with all the latest news.</p>
<p><strong>Open Application Model (OAM)</strong></p>
<p>Open Application Model (OAM) is an open-source specification for building cloud-native applications. It provides a declarative way to define the components of an application, including its services, configuration, and dependencies. In the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32v">Application first delivery on Kubernetes with Open Application Model</a>  Daniel Higuero, CTO of Napptive collaborates with Tsahi Duek, Andreas Lindh, and Siva Guruvareddiar on a hands on guide on how to implement the OAM using KubeVela, an open-source project, which implements the Open Application Model. Great post, well worth checking out. [hands on]</p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong></p>
<p>Last week the OpenSearch community posted, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32z">Introducing OpenSearch 2.9.0</a> with new features designed to help you build better search solutions and integrate more machine learning (ML) into your applications, along with updates for security analytics workloads, geospatial visualisations, and more. Read the post to get all that OpenSearch goodness.</p>
<p><img src="https://opensearch.org/assets/media/blog-images/2023-07-24-introducing-opensearch-2.9.0/associate-existing.gif" alt="overview of opensearch 2.90 new features"></p>
<p>One of the interesting experimental features in this release are Extensions. In the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/330">Introducing extensions for OpenSearch</a> Sarat Vemulapalli, Dan Widdis, Owais Kazi, Daniel (dB.) Doubrovkine, Dagney Braun, Minal Shah, and Fanit Kolchina dive deeper and walk you through what Extensions in OpenSearch are and why it was needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://opensearch.org/assets/media/blog-images/2023-07-25-introducing-extensions-for-opensearch/extensions.png" alt="overview of OpenSearch extensions"></p>
<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition 2 (with MySQL 5.7 compatibility) now supports MySQL 5.7.40. In addition to several security enhancements and bug fixes, this release is fully compatible with MySQL 5.7.40. Previous Aurora MySQL 2.x versions were compatible with MySQL 5.7.12.</p>
<p><strong>IAM Roles Anywhere</strong></p>
<p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles Anywhere is an open source project that enables workloads that run outside of AWS, such as servers, containers, and applications, to use X.509 digital certificates to obtain temporary AWS credentials and access AWS resources using the same IAM roles and policies that you have configured for your AWS workloads to access AWS resources.</p>
<p>IAM Roles Anywhere released credential helper version 1.0.5 to include support for X.509 certificates and private keys that are stored in macOS and Windows certificate stores. IAM Roles Anywhere credential helper is a tool that manages the process of signing the CreateSession API with the private key associated with an X.509 end-entity certificate and calls the endpoint to obtain temporary AWS credentials. With this release, you can now use IAM Roles Anywhere credential helper to delegate signing operations to keys stored within those OS-specific certificate stores, without those keys ever leaving those stores; which can improve your security posture. In Windows, both CryptoAPI and Cryptography API: Next Generation (CNG) are supported; in macOS, Keychain is supported.</p>
<p><strong>MQTT</strong></p>
<p>AWS IoT Core MQTT now supports Device Location. IoT Core Device Location feature allows customers to obtain devices’ location data and build location based applications even when devices don’t have a built in GPS. With IoT Core Device Location feature, customers can use advanced cloud based location solvers, such as Wi-Fi scan, Cellular scan, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) scan, and reverse IP look-up to determine geo-coordinates of their IoT devices for use cases such as map visualisation, historical route tracking, and Geo-fencing. Now, with MQTT support for Device Location, customers can use their MQTT devices’ existing connection and data path with AWS IoT Core to obtain devices’ geo-coordinates and send them to 20+ AWS services, including Amazon Location Service. The added support for MQTT devices eliminates the need of maintaining multiple data paths between IoT devices and AWS IoT Core, simplifying customer’s development process when building location based IoT solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong></p>
<p>A few of updates this week.</p>
<p>First up is news that you can now  store logs for your EMR Serverless Spark and Hive applications in Amazon CloudWatch. Amazon EMR Serverless is a serverless option that makes it simple for data analysts and engineers to run open-source big data analytics frameworks like Apache Spark and Apache Hive without configuring, managing, and scaling clusters or servers. When you submit a job to an EMR Serverless application, you can decide where to store your application logs - in a managed storage system, an Amazon S3 location, or both. Now, you can choose Amazon CloudWatch as an option as well. This feature allows you to take advantage of CloudWatch log analysis features such as CloudWatch Logs Insights, Live Tail etc. as well as stream logs from CloudWatch to other systems such as Amazon OpenSearch for further analysis. When storing logs in Amazon CloudWatch, log data is always encrypted but you can choose to use your own encryption keys as well.</p>
<p>From Amazon EMR Serverless to Amazon EMR on EC2. Announced last week was a new feature that enables user authentication to EMR on EC2 clusters using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) based credentials. This feature allows administrators to configure EMR on EC2 clusters to authenticate corporate identities in their Active Directory (AD) using LDAP. With this launch, AD users are synced to the EMR on EC2 cluster automatically when LDAP authentication is enabled. This simplifies authentication to EMR clusters for administrators by eliminating the manual steps to sync users and/or implementing application-specific LDAP configuration. Amazon EMR on EC2 customers create and manage their corporate user identities and groups in an LDAP directory based service such as AD or openLDAP. With native LDAP integration, end users can authenticate to EMR clusters using their AD credentials and use applications such as Hue, Presto and Livy to run jobs as themselves. This simplifies user authentication with EMR on EC2 clusters using AD and allows corporate users to launch queries and sessions on applications such as Hue, Presto using their LDAP based credentials. Prior to this launch, administrators configured Kerberos to authenticate AD users which is manual and effort-intensive. With this launch, administrators can also enforce fine-grained access control (FGAC) for AD users through Apache Ranger authorisation for Hive Metastore database and tables.</p>
<p>Next, and sticking with Amazon EMR on EC2 was news that two new capabilities that enhances the scaling experience for Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters: a new retry mechanism for faster scaling of your Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters running Presto or Trino; and faster scale-down of Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters by enforcing the data redundancy requirements. These capabilities are automatically enabled for clusters running Amazon EMR 6.12 or higher releases and no action is needed from your end.</p>
<p>Finally, from Amazon EMR on EC2 to Amazon EMR on EKS. Apache Spark with Java 17 in EMR on EKS is now supported. AWS customers can now leverage Java 17 as a supported Java runtime to run Spark workloads on Amazon EMR on EKS, and benefit from Java 17’s language enhancement and performance improvement. Amazon EMR on EKS enables customers to run open-source big data frameworks such as Apache Spark on Amazon EKS. Up until this update, Amazon EMR on EKS ran Spark with Java 8 as the default Java runtime with Java 11 as an option. In order to run Spark on EMR on EKS with Java 17, it requires an additional effort to the customer by creating a custom image, and replacing the default Java 8 runtime with Java 17. With this new feature, customers can now select Java 17 as a supported runtime to run Spark jobs on EMR on EKS.</p>

<p>Check out the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32w">Improved scalability and resiliency for Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters</a>, where Ravi Kumar Singh and Kevin Wikant dive into improvements that AWS has made in Amazon EMR on EC2 with the goal to make your EMR clusters more resilient and stable.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Iceberg</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Redshift today announces the preview release of Apache Iceberg support, enabling users to run analytics queries on Apache Iceberg tables within Redshift. Apache Iceberg, one of the most recent open table formats, has been used by many customers to simplify data processing on rapidly expanding and evolving tables stored in data lakes. You can now use Amazon Redshift to query your Apache Iceberg tables in AWS Glue Data Catalog while other users or applications can safely conduct data manipulation on your tables using ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) compliant services like Amazon EMR, Amazon Athena, and AWS Glue.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Hudi</strong></p>
<p>AWS Glue Crawlers now supports Apache Hudi tables, allowing customers to query data in Apache Hudi tables directly from AWS analytics services like Amazon Athena. Apache Hudi is an open-source table format that brings database and data warehouse capabilities to the data lake. Apache Hudi helps data engineers manage continuously evolving data sets while maintaining query performance. To query data from Apache Hudi tables, previously Amazon Athena users had to manually create a table within the Glue Data Catalog and update partition changes to ensure the query results were current. With today’s launch, users can automatically register Apache Hudi tables into the Glue Catalog by running the Glue Crawler. Glue Crawler supports partitioned and non-partitioned Copy on write (CoW) and Merge on read (MoR) Hudi tables. Users can then query Glue Catalog Hudi tables across various analytics services and apply Lake Formation fine-grained permissions. With Glue Crawlers, users can also migrate data from other Hudi Catalogs to the Glue Catalog.</p>
<p><strong>Go</strong></p>
<p>If you are a Go developer, then make sure you check out <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32n">Migrating AWS Lambda functions from the Go1.x runtime to the custom runtime on Amazon Linux 2</a> where Micah Walter, Yanko Bolanos, and Ramesh Mathikumar describes our plans to improve performance and streamline the user experience for customers writing AWS Lambda functions using Go.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong></p>
<p>On a related note, you can now use Python 3.11 in AWS Lambda. Ramesh Mathikumar, and Francesco Vergona put together <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/331">Python 3.11 runtime now available in AWS Lambda</a> that explores this in more details.</p>

<p><strong>Pacu</strong></p>
<p>Pacu is an open source tool which is used for ethical offensive security . In this video, you’re going to learn how to ethically hack AWS cloud environments that you have explicit permissions for so that you can find exploitable vulnerabilities in your own AWS accounts or for your clients as a pentester, before the bad threat actors do.</p>

<p><strong>AWS User Group UK Meetup #61</strong>
<strong>London, August 16th</strong></p>
<p>AWS User groups regularly meet across the world, and in this London chapter of the AWS User group, Matt Carey will be sharing his talk <em>&ldquo;Building a Viral Open Source AI Chatbot: A Journey from Concept to Reality&rdquo;</em>. From the extract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Learn how we built Quivr - the open-source virtual brain. In 2.5 months we achieved 8k active users of the demo app and a whopping 18k stars on GitHub. We were number 1 on the GitHub trending page for multiple days in a row.
This is the story of how Quivr went viral and how our tiny dev team struggled to build all the features our user base wanted. We will talk about the challenges we faced scaling a generative AI-powered app without it costing the earth on ECS Fargate, and the extra tooling we had to build along the way.
We will cover how we solved the problems of keeping the project open source and super easy to both use and contribute whilst leveraging AWS services in a different way to most.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
