<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p><strong>protonizer</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2ns">protonizer</a> is a CLI tool for working with IaC in <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2nt">AWS Proton</a>. Protonizer allows you take your existing IaC (infrastructure as code) templates and modules and bring them into AWS Proton to scale them out across your organisation. Note that this is an experimental project and currently only supports generating Proton templates based on Terraform and CodeBuild provisioning. The tool also currently only supports primitive HCL data types such as strings, numbers, bools, and lists of primitive types. This is currently aligned with the Proton schema types that are supported by the Proton console.</p>
<p><strong>ec2-former2</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2nu">ec2-former2</a> this repo helps you to deploy an EC2 instance running Former2, an open source project from AWS Hero Ian Mckay that we have featured in this newsletter and on the Build on Open Source show. Former2 is a website that allows you to generate IaC (Infrastructure as Code) templates (such as CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform, etc) from existing AWS resources. Some users have security concerns around entering their AWS credentials on an external website and prefer a private web instance. However, Former2 requires browser helper extension that only works with websites that has domain names 127.0.0.1, localhost, former2.com and <a href="https://www.former2.com">www.former2.com</a>. This repo provides CloudFormation templates that provision an EC2 instance hosting former2, so that users can remote in from their browsers to generate IaC templates and download them.</p>

<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong></p>
<p>We had a flurry of posts for OpenSearch fans this week, starting off with <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2o1">Expanding k-NN with Lucene approximate nearest neighbor search</a> where Stavros Macrakis provides a short post on the variety of options you have for implementing exact and approximate k-NN search</p>
<p>Following that we had Milind Shyani, Dhrubo Saha, Nina Mishra, and Fanit Kolchina come together to write <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2o2">The ABCs of semantic search in OpenSearch: Architectures, benchmarks, and combination strategies</a>. This builds on previous blog posts (linked in the post) and dives deeper in the different ways of building a semantic search engine in OpenSearch.</p>
<p>Finally, in the post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2nx">Perform accent-insensitive search using OpenSearch</a>, Aruna Govindaraju shows you how to perform accent-insensitive search using OpenSearch to handle diacritics. What is &ldquo;diacritics&rdquo; I can hear you all ask. From the blog post itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accent-insensitive search, also called diacritics-agnostic search, is where search results are the same for queries that may or may not contain Latin characters such as à, è, Ê, ñ, and ç. Diacritics are English letters with an accent to mark a difference in pronunciation. In recent years, words with diacritics have trickled into the mainstream English language, such as café or protégé.</p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>Amazon DevOps Guru for RDS is a Machine Learning (ML) powered capability for Amazon RDS that automatically detects and diagnoses database performance and operational issues. DevOps Guru for RDS is a feature of DevOps Guru, which detects operational and performance related issues for Amazon RDS engines and dozens of other resource types. DevOps Guru for RDS expands upon the existing capabilities of DevOps Guru to detect, diagnose, and provide remediation recommendations for a wide variety of database-related performance issues, such as resource over-utilisation and misbehaviour of SQL queries. Announced last week, Amazon DevOps Guru for Amazon RDS now supports Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL.</p>
<p><strong>Terraform</strong></p>
<p>Support for AWS Secrets Manager managed master passwords for RDS and Aurora instances and clusters is now in the AWS provider for Terraform (v4.61.0). See the <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2nv">full release notes here</a>, as well as reading the announcement back in December for this feature <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2nw">here</a>. Hats off to OSS community member Mark Ferguson for his wonderful contribution. Thanks Tyler Lynch for bringing this to my attention.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EMR on EKS</strong></p>
<p>A couple of important updates this week.</p>
<p>First up we had news that you can now define where a Jupyter Enterprise Gateway (JEG) pod can be deployed when running interactive Spark workloads using managed endpoints. Amazon EMR on EKS enables customers to run open-source big data frameworks such as Apache Spark on Amazon EKS. Amazon EMR on EKS customers setup and use a managed endpoint (available in preview) to run interactive workloads using integrated development environments (IDEs) such as EMR Studio. Until now, customers running Jupyter notebooks via managed endpoints had no control over the instance type to deploy their managed endpoint on. If a managed endpoint is deployed on a spot instance, it could run into a situation where access to Jupyter notebooks is lost via the managed managed endpoint, creating an issue customers have to work around. With this feature, customers now have full control on where the JEG pod will be deployed, including the ability to specify an on-demand instance via a managed or self-managed node group.</p>
<p>The second update is support for EKS clusters with both managed and self-managed node groups when using interactive Spark workloads via managed managed endpoints. Amazon EMR on EKS enables  customers to run open-source big data frameworks such as Apache Spark on Amazon EKS. Amazon EMR on EKS customers setup and use a managed endpoint (available in preview) to run interactive workloads using integrated development environments (IDEs) such as EMR Studio. Until now, customers who had EKS clusters configured with self-managed node groups were unable to use EMR Studio with EMR on EKS. With this feature, customers using managed endpoints can now specify EKS clusters with managed or self-managed node groups to run their interactive workloads, with the added flexibility of defining aspects such as on-demand or spot instance types, and specify a custom AMI, among others.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong></p>
<p>Last week we launched new observability features including log patterns, metrics analytics and support for Jaeger traces with OpenSearch 2.5 in Amazon OpenSearch Service. Log patterns provide automated grouping of log data, which can be used to provide new insights into large volumes of log data. These groupings help to detect outliers in large volumes of data, which helps improve your signal to noise ratio and allows you to identify uninteresting logs to optimise storage costs. With the new metrics analytics interface, you can now visualise multiple log-generated metrics like throughput, errors and response times in a single interface and correlate these metrics. The newly added support for popular open source Jaeger format allows you to use the capabilities of OpenSearch to analyse the trace data stored in this format. This expands on the existing support for OTEL format trace data.</p>
<p>The new observability capabilities and log monitoring features are available on the Amazon OpenSearch Service domains running OpenSearch version 2.5 or higher in the AWS Regions where Amazon OpenSearch Service is available.</p>
<p><em>Request for Comment (RFC)</em></p>
<p>The OpenSearch team are looking for feedback on a new proposal on how to update GeoIPs. The proposal is to provide a way to update a GeoIP database in GeoIP processor automatically.

<p><strong>AWS Copilot</strong></p>
<p>Version 1.27 of AWS Copilot that was announced last week enables customers to fully customise AWS Cloud Formation templates, which AWS Copilot uses to provision the service, environment, pipeline, and job resources. Customers can now use AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) or YAML patches to change any property of those AWS resources. AWS Copilot is a command-line interface (CLI) that makes it easier for customers to build, deploy, and operate containerised applications on AWS by providing common application architecture and infrastructure patterns, user-friendly operational workflows, and configuring deployment pipelines.</p>
<p>With the new AWS Copilot release (1.27) users can now run copilot svc override, copilot env override, or copilot job override to enable overrides of any property of a service, environment, or job . Users can choose between two options &ndash;tool cdk or &ndash;tool yamlpatch overrides. With CDK overrides, AWS Copilot bootstraps a new CDK application inside a copilot/<resource name>/overrides/ directory of the user’s project and provides instructions inside stack.ts file on how to use the CDK. Customers can start by editing stack.ts and modify any properties of AWS Cloud Formation resources generated by AWS Copilot before a deployment. Customers who choose to use YAML patch overrides can override the AWS Cloud Formation template via .yaml patch files that adhere to the JSON patch syntax. Both options give customers full control over AWS resources and their properties that AWS Copilot deploys. The feature is available in all regions when using AWS Copilot 1.27 release.</p>
<p><strong>AWS SAM</strong></p>
<p>The AWS Toolkits enables easier development faster by supporting AWS SAM Accelerate in the IDEs letting you edit, deploy, and test your code iteratively. This update is supported in Visual Studio Code or JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Rider, WebStorm, PyCharm, CLion, RubyMine, GoLand and PhpStorm. Customers can quickly deploy and run code changes by selecting the ‘Sync AWS SAM Application’ option from their IDE and run the local changes in the AWS cloud without initiating an AWS CloudFormation deployment. For example, changes to AWS Lambda functions, Lambda Layer resources, AWS StepFunction templates and Amazon APIGateway documents are deployed quickly without an infrastructure deployment. With the ability to rapidly deploy to the AWS Cloud during development, you can iteratively identify issues with your application that are challenging to detect in your local environment.</p>
<p><strong>Bottlerocket</strong></p>
<p>Bottlerocket, a Linux-based operating system that is purpose built to host container workloads, now supports FireLens. Customers using Bottlerocket with Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS) can now benefit from a simpler way to collect logs from Bottlerocket nodes.</p>
<p>FireLens is a container log router for Amazon ECS that allows you to send logs to multiple destinations and that gives you extensibility to use the breadth of services at AWS or partner solutions for log analytics and storage. Please refer to the detailed guide on how to configure a custom log routing using FireLens.</p>
<p>This feature is available on Bottlerocket versions starting from 1.13.0.</p>
<p><strong>Red Hat Linux</strong></p>
<p>NICE DCV is a high-performance remote display protocol that is designed to help customers securely access remote desktop or application sessions, including 3D graphics applications hosted on servers with high-performance GPUs. NICE DCV version 2023.0 introduces multiple enhancements and features, such as support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 and monitor selection for a full-screen remote session on Linux and macOS clients. Check out the full announcement,<a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2nb"> NICE DCV releases version 2023.0 with support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9</a>, for more details about the features and improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) announces domainless Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) support for Windows containers. This helps customers to easily authenticate applications hosted on Amazon EKS with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) using a portable user identity and a plug-in mechanism to retrieve the gMSA credentials for their Windows containers. Now, customers can run containers that require AD authentication without joining the EKS nodes to the domain, even in case of autoscaling events.</p>
<p>Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) is a managed domain account that provides automatic password management, service principal name (SPN) management, and the ability to delegate the management to other administrators over multiple servers/instances. This allows multiple containers or resources to share an AD account without having to authenticate each container or resource individually, or without having access to network-shared resources such as SQL Server hosts, or file-shares. Since the launch of EKS version 1.14, customers can run EKS Windows containers with gMSA by joining underlying nodes to a target AD domain. Now customers can also use a built-in plugin on the latest EKS-Optimized Windows AMIs (versions 1.22 and above) that enables non-domain-joined Windows nodes to retrieve gMSA credentials with a portable user identity instead of a host computer account.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2nn">Domainless Windows Authentication for Amazon EKS Windows pods</a> provides a hands on end-to-end guide on how to get started.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2023/03/24/gMSA-plugin.png" alt="architecture for Domainless Windows Authentication for Amazon EKS Windows pods"></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Also announced last week was the general availability of the AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) for EventBridge and Pipes. This launch allows you to manage EventBridge resources, such as event buses, rules, and pipes, using the Kubernetes API and resource model (custom resource definitions). Amazon EventBridge event buses and pipes are serverless event router and point-to-point integrations that enable you to create scalable event-driven applications by routing events between your own applications, third-party SaaS applications, and other AWS services. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your events, allowing for application architectures to react to changes in your systems as they occur. The EventBridge and Pipes ACK controllers join the 20+ generally available ACK controllers and enable you to create even complex event-driven architectures on Kubernetes by connecting resources from other available ACK controllers, such as S3, SQS, Lambda, and DynamoDB, with a consistent user experience. In the initial release, the two new EventBridge ACK controllers allow you to manage EventBridge event buses, rules, archives, global endpoints, and pipes as Kubernetes resources, with more resources planned in future releases.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The final quick update for Kubernetes is news of the general availability of Amazon GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring to detect runtime threats from over 30 security findings to protect your EKS clusters. You can read the full post from my colleague Channy, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2o0">Amazon GuardDuty Now Supports Amazon EKS Runtime Monitoring</a></p>
