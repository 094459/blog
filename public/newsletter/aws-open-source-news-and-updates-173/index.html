<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p><strong>hypergraph-tabular-lm</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38l">hypergraph-tabular-lm</a> This repository contains the official implementation for the paper <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38m">HyTrel: Hypergraph-enhanced Tabular Data Representation Learning</a> with code, data, and checkpoints. From the abstract we can see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Language models pretrained on large collections of tabular data have demonstrated their effectiveness in several downstream tasks. However, many of these models do not take into account the row/column permutation invariances, hierarchical structure, etc. that exist in tabular data. To alleviate these limitations, we propose HYTREL, a tabular language model, that captures the permutation invariances and three more structural properties of tabular data by using hypergraphs–where the table cells make up the nodes and the cells occurring jointly together in each row, column, and the entire table are used to form three different types of hyperedges.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>dpdk-setup-eks</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/37x">dpdk-setup-eks</a> provides sample code on how you can use packet acceleration using SRIOV (Single Root I/O Virtualization) and DPDK (Data Plane Development Kit) to achieve high network bandwidth, maximum throughput, and minimal latency in your cloud native workloads. SRIOV enables hardware-based acceleration in a virtualised environment that provides higher I/O performance, lower CPU utilisation, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and lower latency. DPDK provides software-based development kit, which bypasses the operating system (OS) kernel and reduces packet processing overhead, resulting in performance improvement and lower latency. To help you get started with this code, following along with the post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/37y">Automate Packet Acceleration configuration using DPDK on Amazon EKS</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/c5b76da3e608d34edb07244cd9b875ee86906328/2023/08/30/Create-EKS-Nodegroup-with-the-pre-built-DPDK-AMI-1024x612.jpg" alt="overview of high performance networking on eks"></p>
<p><strong>aws-ebpf-sdk-go</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38k">aws-ebpf-sdk-go</a> is a Golang based SDK for kernel eBPF operations i.e, load/attach/detach eBPF programs and create/delete/update maps. SDK relies on Unix bpf() system calls. This SDK currently supports eBPF program types (a. Traffic Classifiers b. XDP c. Kprobes/Kretprobes d. Tracepoint probes), and Ring buffer (would need kernel 5.10+). The SDK currently does not support Map in Map and Perf buffer. This is the first version of SDK and interface is subject to change so kindly review the release notes before upgrading.</p>
<p><strong>static-checker-flink</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38n">static-checker-flink</a> The goal of this project is to catch certain issues with Apache Flink applications fast (during build/packaging). Covered cases include Kinesis connector compatibility issues, Apache Kafka connector compatibility issues, and MSK IAM Auth library issues. As an example of how you might use this, did you know that you have to use AWS Kinesis Connector 1.15.4 or above for Apache Flink 1.15 apps? This plugin is there to stop you from building an app that has such incompatible connector versions.</p>
<p><strong>managed-service-for-apache-flink-blueprints</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38o">managed-service-for-apache-flink-blueprints</a> are a curated collection of Apache Flink applications. Each blueprint will walk you through how to solve a practical problem related to stream processing using Apache Flink. These blueprints can be leveraged to create more complex applications to solve your business challenges in Apache Flink, and they are designed to be extensible. We will feature examples for both the DataStream and Table API where possible.</p>
<p>Currently the repo contains two blueprints, and you will find examples of Apache Flink applications that can be run locally, on an open source Apache Flink cluster, or on Managed Service for Apache Flink cluster.</p>
<h3 id="demos-samples-solutions-and-workshops">Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops</h3>
<p><strong>generative-ai-demo-on-miro</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38g">generative-ai-demo-on-miro</a> is the source code for a super cool demo that shows three Generative AI use-cases integrated into single solution on Miro board (digital whiteboard). It turns Python notebooks into dynamic interactive experience, where several team members can brainstorm, explore, exchange ideas empowered by privately hosted Sagemaker generative AI models. This demo can be easily extended by adding use-cases to demonstrate new concepts and solutions.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws-samples/generative-ai-demo-on-miro/blob/main/media/genai-demo-960x540_low_fps.gif?raw=true" alt="demo of generative miro board"></p>
<p><strong>lambda-rag</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38h">lambda-rag</a> is  a Retrieval Augmented Generation Chat AI Demo from AWS Hero Ken Collins. This OpenAI based RAG chat application that can help you learn about AI retrieval patterns. The technologies here are beginner friendly and easy to deploy to AWS Lambda. You will need an OpenAI API key to run this application, so check out the README for more details on other dependencies.</p>
<p>To help you get started and help explain everything,  Ken has put together a couple of great blog posts that really do a fantastic job of explaining the approach and the details. Make sure you read <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38j">RAGs To Riches - Part #1 Generative AI &amp; Retrieval</a>, and the not surprisingly named, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38i">RAGs To Riches - Part #2 Building On Lambda</a></p>

<p><strong>griptape-hello-world</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38e">griptape-hello-world</a> Griptape is an open source project that provides an enterprise grade alternative to tools like LangChain, and in this repo I share some code that I put together whilst testing it out as part of writing a short blog post on this project, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38f">Getting gnarly with AI - a quick look at Griptape, an enterprise ready alternative to LangChain</a>. Let me know what you think if you try this out.</p>
<p><strong>genai-jumpstart-amplify-cdk-app</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/383">genai-jumpstart-amplify-cdk-app</a> In this project we show you how you can take a SageMaker Generative AI model, expose it as a SageMaker Endpoint and consume the Foundational Model in a React Amplify front end. This sample project also demonstrates an implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation using AWS OpenSearch. The project illustrates how to take sample documents and use a SageMaker Endpoint running an Embeddings LLM to get the embeddings and create an embeddings index within OpenSearch. The app integrates with Cognito for authentication. All the backend components including Lambda, SageMaker Endpoints, OpenSearch, Fargate all run within a VPC.</p>
<p>Jay Pillai, Shikhar Kwatra, and Karthik Sonti have put together a detailed blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/384">Build a secure enterprise application with Generative AI and RAG using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart</a>, to help bootstrap you with this code.</p>

<h3 id="aws-and-community-blog-posts">AWS and Community blog posts</h3>
<p><strong>Community round up</strong></p>
<p>The community round up is my favourite part of the newsletter, as I get to read about some of the great open source work being done by the AWS community. This week starts off with AWS Community Builder Supratip Banerjee who takes a look at how to build Data version control using lakeFS, an open-source project that provides format-agnostic version control for data lakes, in the post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38a">A Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing Data Version Control</a>. Next up we have Nathan Peck who has put together <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38b">Deploy Jupyter notebook container with Amazon ECS</a>, which is a nice detailed blueprint that shows how you can deploy Jupyter notebooks on Amazon ECS, leveraging underlying infrastructure optimised for AI (AWS Inferentia and AWS Trainium instance types). AWS Community Builders Lionel Tchami takes a look at setting up CI/CD pipelines using GitLab in his post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38c">Every Project Deserves its CI/CD pipeline, no matter how small</a>, something I think we can all agree on. To wrap things up this week, we finish with Dr. Aparna Sundar who has put together <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38d">OpenSearch Dashboards: A usability snapshot</a> that takes a look at the approach taken to enhance the user experience for OpenSearch users.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Corretto</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider (ACCP)  is a collection of high-performance cryptographic implementations exposed via standard JCA/JCE interfaces, something I have spoken and demoed in the past. It is super cool stuff! I was therefore delighted when I saw Will Childs-Klein&rsquo;s post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/37z">Accelerating JVM cryptography with Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider 2</a> which looks at the updated version (ACCP 2) delivers comprehensive performance enhancements, with some algorithms (such as elliptic curve key generation) seeing a greater than 13-fold improvement over ACCP 1. This release also sees changes to the backing cryptography library for ACCP from OpenSSL (used in ACCP 1) to the AWS open source cryptography library, AWS libcrypto (AWS-LC). If you are a Java developer, then this is a must read post this week.</p>

<p><strong>Smithy</strong></p>
<p>Smithy is an open-source Interface Definition Language (IDL) and set of tools for building web services, created by AWS. AWS uses Smithy to model services, generate server scaffolding, generate SDKs for multiple languages, and generate AWS SDKs. Andrew Foss is excited to announce the release of a new capability, which he writes about in his post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/389">Creating Smithy Projects with Smithy Init</a>. The release of the init command in Smithy CLI, enables developers to create new Smithy projects quickly and easily. Jump into the post to find out more about Smithy and this new update.

<p><strong>AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio</strong></p>
<p>Announced last week was news that the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio is now generally available on the Arm64 version of Visual Studio (aka “Arm64 Visual Studio”). This release enables a Visual Studio user on a native Windows Arm64 device or on a device emulating Windows Arm64 on a M class Apple device to leverage the same AWS tooling that has been available to x64 versions of Visual Studio. You can read the full details in the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/382">AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio adds support for Arm64 Visual Studio</a></p>
<p><strong>AWS SDK</strong></p>
<p>There is an upcoming change in the S3 GetObjectAttributes API, and so John Viegas has put together a post that users of the AWS SDK for Java v2, AWS SDK for .NET v3, and AWS Tools for PowerShell should read and understand how they can prepare. You can catch the post here, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/385">Update to AWS SDK for Java v2, AWS SDK for .NET v3, and AWS Tools for PowerShell when using S3 GetObjectAttributes API</a></p>
<p><strong>Apache Airflow</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) has added certifications for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP). Amazon Web Services (AWS) maintains certifications through extensive audits of its controls to ensure that information security risks that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company and customer information are appropriately managed.</p>
<p>Amazon MWAA is a managed orchestration service for Apache Airflow that makes it easier to set up and operate end-to-end data pipelines in the cloud. Amazon MWAA has certification for compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 27017:2015, 27018:2019, 27701:2019, 22301:2019, 9001:2015, and CSA STAR CCM v4.0. You can download copies of the AWS ISO certificates and use them to jump-start your own certification efforts. Further, with IRAP certification, you can meet the Australian Government Information Security Manual (ISM) control objectives while using Amazon MWAA.</p>
<p>In addition to ISO and IRAP certification, Amazon MWAA is also Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) eligible, in scope for System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports, and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI) compliant.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL and PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) announces Amazon RDS Extended Support for Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS database instances running MySQL 5.7, PostgreSQL 11, and higher major versions beyond the community end of life. Amazon RDS Extended Support provides you more time, up to three years, to upgrade to a new major version to help you meet your business requirements. Extended Support is available for Aurora MySQL-compatible edition, Aurora PostgreSQL-compatible edition, RDS for MySQL and RDS for PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Starting in December, 2023, you will be able to opt-in to Amazon RDS Extended Support through the AWS Console, CLI, and APIs. When you opt-in to Extended Support, Amazon RDS will provide critical security and bug fixes for your MySQL and PostgreSQL databases after the community ends support for a major version. You can run your databases on Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS with Extended Support for up to three years beyond a major version’s end of standard support date. Learn more about Extended Support, including supported engine versions, in the Amazon Aurora user guide and Amazon RDS User Guide.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS Extended Support is now available for Aurora MySQL-Compatible version 2 and higher, Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible version 11 and higher, RDS for MySQL major versions 5.7 and higher, and RDS for PostgreSQL major versions 11 and higher in AWS Commercial and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions.</p>
<p>Find out more by reading the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/37w">Introducing Amazon RDS Extended Support for MySQL databases on Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS</a>, where Vijay Karumajji makes some compelling arguments why you should try and upgrade, but failing that, how  Amazon RDS Extended Support can help.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2023/09/01/DBBLOG-3499_img1-1024x308.png" alt="overview of extended support diagram for MySQL"></p>
<p><strong>PostreSQL</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the Extended support news just mentioned, there are a couple of other updates worth noting.</p>
<p>First is news that Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL now supports the h3-pg extension, which provides an API to H3, an open-source hexagonal, hierarchical geospatial indexing system. With this extension, you can perform different kinds of spatial analysis over large datasets, including efficient indexing and lookups, modeling flow through a grid, and applying machine learning models over your geospatial data stored in Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The H3 library provides an invariant set of hexagonal map tiles over multiple layers of resolution. This allows the h3-pg extension to index your geospatial data so you can efficiently query data on your maps. For example, a retailer planning new outlets may want to create a heatmap visualisation using traffic, mobility, demographic, and other geospatial datasets to identify locations best suited for their customers. You can also use H3 and PostGIS together to perform different geospatial analyses. h3-pg is available on database instances in Amazon RDS running PostgreSQL 15.4, 14.9, 13.12 and higher in all applicable AWS Regions.</p>
<p>Finally, Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 Release Candidate 1 (RC1) is now available in the Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment, allowing you to evaluate the pre-release of PostgreSQL 16 on Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. You can deploy PostgreSQL 16 RC1 in the Preview Environment and have the same benefits of a fully managed database, making it simpler to set up, operate, and monitor databases. PostgreSQL 16RC1 in the Preview Environment also includes support for logical decoding on read replicas, AWS libcrypto (AWS-LC), and over 80 PostgreSQL extensions such as pgvector, pg_tle, h3-pg, pg_cron, and rdkit.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL community released PostgreSQL 16 RC1 on August 31, 2023 that enables logical replication from standbys and includes numerous performance improvements. PostgreSQL 16 also adds support for SQL/JSON constructors and identity functions, more query types that can use parallelism, introduction of using SIMD CPU acceleration, and the ‘pg_stat_io’ view that provides statistics on I/O usage. The Amazon RDS Database Preview Environment supports the latest generation of instance classes that are retained for a maximum period of 60 days and are automatically deleted after the retention period. Amazon RDS database snapshots that are created in the Preview Environment can only be used to create or restore database instances within the Preview Environment. You can use the PostgreSQL dump and load functionality to import or export your databases from the Preview Environment.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)</strong></p>
<p>The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) Command Line Interface (CLI) announces the launch of SAM CLI local testing and debugging on HashiCorp Terraform. The AWS SAM CLI is a developer tool that makes it easier to build, test, package, and deploy serverless applications. Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, and version cloud and on-premises resources safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>Customers can now use the SAM CLI to locally test and debug AWS Lambda functions and Amazon API Gateway defined in their Terraform application. SAM CLI can read the infrastructure resource information from the Terraform project and start Lambda functions and API Gateway endpoints locally running in a Docker container. Customers can invoke their function or API endpoint with an event payload, or attach a debugger using AWS toolkits on IDE to step through the Lambda function code. Previously, SAM CLI only supported local testing and debugging on CloudFormation templates. With this change, Terraform users can use the SAM CLI local testing commands like sam local start-api, sam local start-lambda and sam local invoke on their Terraform projects to speed up their development cycles. They can also use sam local generate command to generate mock test events for local testing.</p>
<p>This feature is supported with Terraform version 1.1+ and you can find out more by reading the post from Eric Johnson, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/37v">AWS SAM support for HashiCorp Terraform now generally available</a></p>
<p><strong>PyTorch</strong></p>
<p>SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoint (MME) is a fully managed capability that allows customers to deploy 1000s of models on a single SageMaker endpoint and reduce costs. Until today, MME was not supported for PyTorch models deployed using TorchServe. Now, customers can use MME to deploy 1000s of PyTorch models using TorchServe to reduce inference costs.</p>
<p>Customers are increasingly building ML models using PyTorch to achieve business outcomes, To deploy these ML models, customers use TorchServe on CPU/GPU instances to meet desired latency and throughput goals. However, costs can add up if customers are deploying 10+ models. With MME support for TorchServe, customers can deploy 1000s of PyTorch based models on a single SageMaker endpoint. Behind the scenes, MME will run multiple models on a single instance and dynamically load/unload models across multiple instances based on the incoming traffic. With this feature, customers can save costs, as they can share instances behind an endpoint across 1000s of models and only pay for the number of instances used.</p>
<p>This feature supports PyTorch models which use SageMaker TorchServe Inference Container with all machine learning optimised CPU instances and single GPU instances in ml.g4dn, ml.g5, ml.p2, ml.p3 family. It is also available in all regions supported by Amazon SageMaker.</p>

<p><strong>Start building with PL/Rust in Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>Rust combines the performance and resource efficiency of compiled languages like C with mechanisms that limit the risks from unsafe memory use. As a PostgreSQL trusted procedural language, PL/Rust provides memory safety so that an unprivileged user can run code in the database without the risk of crashing the database due to a software defect that corrupts memory. Developers can also package PL/Rust code as Trusted Language Extensions (TLE) for PostgreSQL to run on Amazon RDS. RDS for PostgreSQL customers can now use Rust to build high performance user defined functions to extend PostgreSQL for compute-intensive data processing.</p>
<p>In this session, Sukhpreet Bedi provides a brief introduction to Rust, walk you through how to deploy RDS for PostgreSQL with PL/Rust enabled, and show you how to write high-performance Rust code directly to your database.</p>
