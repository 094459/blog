  <title>AWS open source news and updates No. 39 | Beachgeek blog - a refuge for pineapple on pizza lovers</title>

  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="AWS open source news and updates No. 39"/>
<meta name="twitter:description" content="October 12th - Instalment #39 Week No.39 - The 39 Steps is a pretty famous film, a spy thriller if you are into those types of films and I recently found out that the name came from a location not too far from me. I am pleased to say that episode 39 of this newsletter is equally thrilling, combining the usual mix of new open source projects (including one so fresh, it is still warm to the touch), blog posts, case studies and events for you to check out."/>

<p><strong>AWS ParallelCluster</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/using-multiple-queues-and-instance-types-in-aws-parallelcluster-2-9/">Using multiple queues and instance types in AWS ParallelCluster 2.9</a> Nathan Stornetta and Anh Tran share some of the new features available in the latest release of the open source project, AWS ParallelCluster. AWS ParallelCluster has made it simple for high performance computing (HPC) customers to set up easy-to-use environments with compute, storage, job scheduling, and networking in the cloud in one cohesive package. In version 2.9, two new features covered in this post are around how this new release support multiple job queues and multiple instance types.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple job queues - a common setup inside many traditional HPC environments is to use multiple queues that have varying levels of priority and different compute resources associated with them. This helps ensure that the most urgent workloads have prioritised access to any resources they require, whereas other workloads can wait longer or run on resources with lower costs.</li>
<li>Multiple instance types - allows you to separate workflows into either multiple queues or multiple instance types within the same queue and select distinct compute resources optimised for the price/performance or memory/CPU of each step in our workflow or for different workload types.</li>
</ul>
<p>These new features enable customers to have more complex and varied HPC workflows that can be used to optimise costs and help with things like prioritisation.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/using-jenkins-with-codeartifact/">Integrating Jenkins with AWS CodeArtifact to publish and consume Python artifacts</a> Matt Ulinski shows you how you can manage/publish your software packages and then consume these within your Jenkins projects. The walkthrough takes you through the package/publish and consume/deploy process, ending up with the sample application deployed on AWS Fargate. You will learn everything you need to set up your own environment, and to make it even easier, Matt provides you with a CloudFormation template that will deploy the solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/7719a1c782a1ba91c031a682a0a2f8658209adbf/2020/08/29/jenkins-ca-python.png" alt="arch"></p>
<p><strong>AWS CDK</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/migrating-cloudformation-templates-to-the-aws-cloud-development-kit/">Migrating CloudFormation templates to the AWS Cloud Development Kit</a> from Adam Ruka writes how using a new feature of AWS CDK, you can now import your existing CloudFormation templates into your CDK stack. Once loaded, you can then modify objects defined in your templates directly within your CDK code, or reference existing template resources when creating new CDK constructs. The <strong>CfnInclude</strong> class is what makes this happen. Adam covers some use cases and where you might find this useful and there are some things you need to watch out for. So, now that you have an idea, check out the blog post for the deep dive with examples.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Redshift</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/building-high-quality-benchmark-tests-for-redshift-using-open-source-tools-best-practices/">Building high-quality benchmark tests for Redshift using open-source tools: Best practices</a> in the first of a series of posts, Asser Moustafa talks about how open source tools are often the preferred choice when customers look to profile and benchmark workloads, and shares some best practices and things to look out for. So if you have been using tools like SQLWorkbench, psql, and Apache JMeter then you should check out what Asser has to say.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2020/09/16/bemchmarking-redshift-2.jpg" alt="test"></p>

Also, make sure you check out the Amazon ElastiCache Day, a free virtual event - see above in the Events section.</p>
<p>In further news, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis and Memcached are now supported to run on Graviton2 M6g and R6g instance types, which is great for customers who will now be able to enjoy better price/performance characteristics that these instance types provide. To read more about this, check the release note <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/amazon-elasticache-now-supports-m6g-and-r6g-graviton2-based-instances/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Elasticsearch</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/automating-index-state-management-for-amazon-es/">Automating Index State Management for Amazon ES</a> Satya Vajrapu&rsquo;s post show you how to use policies that have been introduced with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/ism.html">Index State Management (ISM)</a> to implement a sample policy to automate routine index management tasks and apply them to indexes and index patterns. Maintaining multiple indexes for diverse data workloads, typically means the setting up of custom solutions to manage the indexes’ lifecycle which can quickly become tedious as the indexes grow and result in housekeeping overheads. ISM allows you to automate those tasks via policies and you can use a variety of criteria when defining those policies. Take a peek for more details on what those might be.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2020/10/05/index-state-es-12-1.jpg" alt="index"></p>
<p><strong>.NET Core</strong></p>
<p>This great demo from Steve Roberts walks you through how you can use Porting Assistance for .NET to modernise your .NET applications and move them to .NET Core.  You will see how to install and configure the assistant, followed by how you use it to analyse and assess both the effort required, and the optimal places to start, when porting a typical .NET Framework application to .NET Core.  The video also shows how you can use the Porting Assistant to safely update project files, determine NuGet package version upgrades, and locate API calls in the source code that need to be resolved to make the application&rsquo;s projects compatible with .NET Core.</p>

<p>Apache Hudi is an open source data management framework used to simplify incremental data processing and data pipeline development. It was originally developed at Uber in 2016 to enable faster data for petabyte-scale data analytics, low latency database ingestion, and high efficiency and is often used for simplified data pipelines into data lakes and analytics services, Change Data Capture (CDC) with record-level granularity, and near real-time analytics of data sets by SQL query engines like Apache Hive and Presto.</p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>Fluent Bit v1.6</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://fluentbit.io/announcements/v1.6.0/">Fluent Bit v1.6</a> was announced over the weekend, with major contributions from AWS in both new features and improvements. New new plugins were created (for Amazon S3 and Amazon Kinesis) as well as some other improvements to AWS integration.</p>
<p><strong>New open datasets available</strong></p>
<p>Thirty-two new or updated datasets from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the First Street Foundation, Ookla, and others are available on the Registry of Open Data. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/new-aws-public-datasets-available/">Check out the release note</a> for more info, but if you are looking for the latest open data covering COVID-19, Life sciences, Geospatial, climate and weather, machine learning or networking datasets, there is something for you in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Flink</strong></p>
<p>Apache Flink Kinesis Consumer now supports Enhanced Fan Out (EFO) and the HTTP/2 data retrieval API for Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. EFO allows Amazon Kinesis Data Streams consumers to scale by offering each consumer a dedicated read throughput up to 2MB/second. The HTTP/2 data retrieval API reduces latency of data delivery from producers to consumers to 70 milliseconds or better. In combination, these two features allow you to build low latency Apache Flink applications that utilize dedicated throughput from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.</p>
<p>Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics is the easiest way to transform and analyze streaming data in real time with Apache Flink. Apache Flink is an open source framework and engine for processing data streams. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics reduces the complexity of building and managing Apache Flink applications. Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink integrates with Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, Amazon DynamoDB streams, Amazon S3, custom integrations, and more using built-in connectors. You can learn more about Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink here.</p>
<p><strong>Redis</strong></p>
<p>Amazon ElastiCache for Redis now supports Redis 6. This release brings several new and important features to Amazon ElastiCache for Redis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed Role-Based Access Control – Amazon ElastiCache for Redis 6 now provides you with the ability to create and manage users and user groups that can be used to set up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Redis commands. You can now simplify your architecture while maintaining security boundaries by having several applications use the same Redis cluster without being able to access each other’s data. You can also take advantage of granular access control and authorization to create administration and read-only user groups. Amazon ElastiCache enhances the new Access Control Lists (ACL) introduced in open source Redis 6 to provide a managed RBAC experience, making it easy to set up access control across several Amazon ElastiCache for Redis clusters.</li>
<li>Client-Side Caching - Amazon ElastiCache for Redis 6 comes with server-side enhancements to deliver efficient client-side caching to further improve your application performance. Redis clusters now support client-side caching by tracking client requests and sending invalidation messages for data stored on the client. In addition, you can also take advantage of a broadcast mode that allows clients to subscribe to a set of notifications from Redis clusters.</li>
<li>Significant Operational Improvements - This release also includes several enhancements that improve application availability and reliability. Specifically, Amazon ElastiCache has improved replication under low memory conditions, especially for workloads with medium/large sized keys, by reducing latency and the time it takes to perform snapshots. Open source Redis enhancements include improvements to expiry algorithm for faster eviction of expired keys and various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>JMeter</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/distributed-load-testing-on-aws/">Distributed Load Testing</a> on AWS helps you easily simulate thousands of users connecting to your application so that you can better understand your application performance under load. The solution launches and configures containers on AWS Fargate to generate a specified number of transactions per second without having to provision servers.</p>
<p>This update adds support for JMeter test scripts. JMeter is a popular open source application for testing functional behavior and performance, and this update allows customers to use JMeter scripts to test the robustness of their applications. This update also introduces AWS Step Functions to reduce solution complexity.</p>
