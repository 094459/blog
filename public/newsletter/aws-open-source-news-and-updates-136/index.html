<p>The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created.</p>
<p>So thank you to the following open source heroes: Jonathan Swinney, Bharathi (Batty) Muthukrishnan, Conrad Wiebe, Evan Spearman, Subbusainath Rengasamy, Kartik Kalamadi, Rahul Kharse, Changbin Gong, Sandeep Palavalasa, Dan Mangum, Manabu McCloskey, Nima Kaviani, Kanwaljit Khurmi, James Eastham, Mike Jerome, Abhi Khanna, Ricardo Ferreira, Pavlo Iatsiuk, Jayaprakash Alawala, Paavan Mistry, Anton Babenko, Suresh Poopandi, Seb Kasprzak, Sheetal Joshi and Vipin Mohan.</p>
<h3 id="latest-open-source-projects">Latest open source projects</h3>
<p><em>The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.</em></p>
<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p><strong>dynamoit</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29f">dynamoit</a> this project (love the name!) from Pavlo Iatsiuk is a simple DynamoDB graphical client written on JavaFX. This client allows easy viewing, editing, creating, and deleting of data.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/bykka/dynamoit/blob/master/docs/images/edit_screen.png?raw=true" alt="screenshot of dynamoit"></p>
<p><strong>building-apache-kafka-connectors</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/294">building-apache-kafka-connectors</a> this repo from my colleague Ricardo Ferreira provides sample code that shows the important aspects of developing custom connectors for Kafka Connect. It provides the resources for building, deploying, and running the code on-premises using Docker, as well as running the code in the cloud. Building connectors for Apache Kafka is hard. Chances are that you just read the previous sentence, and you subconsciously nodded with your head. The reason this happens is that Kafka Connect, which is the runtime platform behind the executing connectors, uses a not so trivial software architecture. There is also a lack of a proper documentation that teaches how the development framework works, how it connects with the runtime, and which best practices you must follow. For situations like this, your best bet is to get hold of an existing code and try to do the same, hoping your own connector will be written the best way possible.</p>
<p><strong>msk-config-providers</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/299">msk-config-providers</a> In Apache Kafka, you can use the ConfigProvider class interface to prevent secrets from appearing in cleartext in connector configurations. This repository provides samples of Apache Kafka Config Providers that can be used to integrate Kafka client properties with other systems. It provides integration with AWS Secrets Manager, AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and Amazon S3.</p>
<p><strong>stowrs-to-s3</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/297">stowrs-to-s3</a> <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/298">STOW-RS</a> is a standard specification for how to transfer images to target systems, typically used in medical imaging systems. This project is a Python based STOW-RS to S3 Service. This service receives DICOM PS18 compliant STOW-RS requests to store, and copies the data to a specified S3 bucket over parallel threads. This project can be deployed either in the AWS Cloud or on-premises. The project comes with an AWS CDK infrastructure as code package allowing to deploy it to the AWS Cloud easily, and can also be executed as a normal python process or as an OCI container ( eg. docker image ) if deployed on-premises.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws-samples/stowrs-to-s3/blob/main/img/clientauth.png?raw=true" alt="architecture of stowrs solution"></p>
<p><strong>aws-device-lobby</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29a">aws-device-lobby</a> This solution provides a method for QR code onboarding of devices to AWS IoT Core. It simplifies the provisioning and onboarding process of devices by removing the requirement that an end cloud account/region is known at the time of device provisioning in the factory. This enables device makers to produce generic IoT devices not bound to end cloud services. IoT platform operators are then able to attach these devices to their services in the field in a flexible manner.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-device-lobby/blob/main/images/AWSDeviceLobby_Architecture.png?raw=true" alt="architecture of iot device lobby"></p>
<p><strong>aws-hpc-builder</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29h">aws-hpc-builder</a> is a universal HPC application(which is called module for the builder) build and management system that make it easy for you to compile and deploy HPC applications on Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux 2022, which support all major platforms that are Intel/AMD/Graviton. This tool compiles HPC applications(WRF, VASP etc.) and their dependencies with vendor compilers or GNU compilers. It standardizes and modularizes the build procedure across all supported platforms.</p>

<p><strong>deploy-stable-diffusion-model-on-amazon-sagemaker-endpoint</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29i">deploy-stable-diffusion-model-on-amazon-sagemaker-endpoint</a> Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model that is similar to other applications such as Dall-E and Midjourney. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, and is getting a lot of interest at the moment. This repo contains notebooks that show you how you can deploy this onto Amazon Sagemaker so that you can start generating your own images.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws-samples/deploy-stable-diffusion-model-on-amazon-sagemaker-endpoint/blob/main/sample_img/1.png?raw=true" alt="example stable difusion image"></p>
<p><strong>aws-graviton-run-confidential-ml-workloads-using-nitro-enclaves</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/296">aws-graviton-run-confidential-ml-workloads-using-nitro-enclaves</a> Over the past three editions of this newsletter, we have seen more projects using AWS Nitro Enclaves. These have been either to show case use cases or to provide additional tooling to make it easier to use. AWS Nitro Enclaves enables customers to create isolated compute environments to maintain confidentiality of applications and data. The sample provided uses Nitro enclaves to enable sensitive file sharing and usage for ML workloads. The repo shows you how you can share your sensitive AI/ML files in a manner that safeguards application and data confidentiality. To present you with a familiar environment, we included the ability to do seamless data transfers to accelerate ML and DS workloads, as well as run software downloaded at runtime to process that data conveniently.</p>

<p><strong>amazon-memorydb-for-redis-java-client-examples</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29g">amazon-memorydb-for-redis-java-client-examples</a> This repository contains examples for using Java clients to interact with Amazon MemoryDB for Redis. These examples demonstrate the following, How to connect/disconnect to Amazon MemoryDB for Redis using the open-source Redis client Jedis, Add/update records to the database, Retrieve records by key and field/path, and Delete records by key.</p>
<p><strong>msk-serverless-data-pipeline</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/295">msk-serverless-data-pipeline</a> Serverless services allow us to build applications without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure. This allows developers to avoid provisioning, scaling, and managing resource utilisation. This repo contains code used in the workshop where you will build a serverless data pipeline using Amazon MSK Serverless which enables data to be consumed from many different client applications to accomplish downstream tasks such as dashboards and analytics. CloudFormation template will help you provision the infrastructure, then you will need to build the Java application yourself as the consumer.</p>

<h3 id="aws-and-community-blog-posts">AWS and Community blog posts</h3>
<p><strong>Terraform</strong></p>
<p>AWS Hero Anton Babenko shared <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29j">this update on LinkedIn</a> about his aim on working on Serverless deployments on Terrform. Now thanks to Antons work, there is a new section on <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29k">Serverless Land</a> that allows you to filter the Serverless patterns for those who prefer using Terraform AWS modules. There are seven patterns currently, but Anton is working on more so make sure you connect/follow Anton so you keep up to date with these as they drop.</p>
<p><strong>GraphQL</strong></p>
<p>AWS Enthusiast Subbusainath Rengasamy has put together this blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29x">How to create AWS AppSync with Lambda Authorizer using AWS CDK v2 with Nested Stack</a> shows you how you can get started with GraphQL on AWS using AWS AppSync and AWS CDK.

<p><strong>FFmpeg</strong></p>
<p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source software project consisting of a suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. I have used this tool many times in the past (one of my favourite uses is to stitch together pictures from my Raspberry Pi time lapse app into a nice movie). In the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29t">Optimized Video Encoding with FFmpeg on AWS Graviton Processors</a> Jonathan Swinney explores how with recent improvements to the project, you can now run this in a more cost effective and more sustainable way using AWS Graviton instance types.

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>Apache Airflow</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) is now HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) eligible, something I know a lot of customers have been asking for. Amazon MWAA is a managed orchestration service for Apache Airflow that makes it easier to set up and operate end-to-end data pipelines in the cloud. HIPAA eligibility means that customers subject to HIPAA—including health insurance companies, healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouses, government programs that pay for healthcare, military and veterans&rsquo; health programs, as well as their associates—can now use Amazon MWAA to manage AWS workflows that store, process or transmit Protected Health Information (PHI). If you have a HIPAA Business Associate Addendum (BAA) in place with AWS, you can now start using Amazon MWAA for workflows handling PHI on new environments.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL now supports MySQL minor version 8.0.31. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of MySQL, and to benefit from the numerous fixes, performance improvements, and new functionality added by the MySQL community.</p>
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL now supports MySQL minor version 5.7.40. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of MySQL, and to benefit from the numerous fixes, performance improvements, and new functionality added by the MySQL community.</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>Following the announcement of updates to the PostgreSQL database by the open source community, we have updated Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition to support PostgreSQL 14.5, 13.8, 12.12, and 11.17. These releases contain bug fixes and improvements by the PostgreSQL community. This release includes new features for Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL version 2.2. Refer to the Aurora version policy to help you to decide how often to upgrade and how to plan your upgrade process. As a reminder, if you are running any version of Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 10, you must upgrade to a newer major version by January 31, 2023.</p>
<p>This release also contains an improvement for logical replication performance. This improvement, enabled as a write-through cache, will help improve the performance of Aurora PostgreSQL when continuously reading a logical replication stream (to minimise replication lag). Each replication slot can read recent data from the cache instead of Aurora Storage. In addition to performance improvements, the cache can help reduce I/O. The cache is available for Aurora PostgreSQL versions 14.5, 13.8, 12.12, and 11.17.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes</strong></p>
<p>A very busy week for Kubernetes updates.</p>
<p>First up was news that you can now use Amazon EKS and Amazon EKS Distro to run Kubernetes version 1.24.Notable changes in Kubernetes version 1.24 include containerd replacing Docksershim as the container runtime, a change to beta API behaviour, and topology aware hints for efficient traffic routing being enabled by default. Additionally, you should note that PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) is scheduled for removal in Kubernetes 1.25. For detailed information on these changes, see the EKS blog post and the Kubernetes project release notes. You can dive deeper by checking out the blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29m">Amazon EKS now supports Kubernetes version 1.24</a> from Sheetal Joshi and Vipin Mohan.</p>
<p>The AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) for the Amazon EC2 service controller is now generally available. ACK lets you provision and manage EC2 networking resources, such as VPCs, SecurityGroups and Internet Gateways using the Kubernetes API. ACK lets you define and use AWS service resources directly from Kubernetes clusters. With ACK, you can take advantage of AWS managed services for your Kubernetes applications without needing to define resources outside of the cluster or run services that provide supporting capabilities like databases, message queues or instances within the cluster. ACK now supports 14 AWS service controllers as generally available with an additional 12 in preview.</p>
<p><strong>Prometheus</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus now supports 200M active metrics per workspace. Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a fully managed Prometheus-compatible monitoring service that makes it easy to monitor and alarm on operational metrics at scale. Prometheus is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation open source project for monitoring and alerting that is optimised for container environments such as Amazon EKS and Amazon ECS. With this release, customers can send up to 200M active metrics to a single workspace after filing a limit increase, and can create many workspaces per account, enabling the storage and analysis of billions of Prometheus metrics. Find out more by reading <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29n">Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus adds support for 200M active metrics</a> from Abhi Khanna.</p>
<p><strong>AWS SAM</strong></p>
<p>The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) Command Line Interface (CLI) announces the preview of AWS Lambda local testing and debugging on Terraform. The AWS SAM CLI is a developer tool that makes it easier to build, test, package, and deploy serverless applications. Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, and version cloud and on-premises resources safely and efficiently. Customers can now use the SAM CLI to locally test and debug a Lambda function defined in their Terraform application. SAM CLI can read the infrastructure resource information from the Terraform project and start Lambda functions locally in a docker container to invoke with an event payload, or attach a debugger using AWS toolkits on IDE to step through the Lambda function code. This feature is supported with Terraform version 1.1 +. For the most seamless experience, use it with the terraform-aws-modules/lambda version 4.6.1+. If you want to get hands on, then read <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/29l">Better together: AWS SAM CLI and HashiCorp Terraform</a></p>
<p><strong>RabbitMQ</strong></p>
<p>Amazon MQ now provides support for RabbitMQ version 3.10, a new release which includes several fixes and improvements to the previous versions of RabbitMQ supported by Amazon MQ, 3.8 and 3.9. With RabbitMQ 3.10, we have enabled support for the latest version of classic queues (CQv2) as default, which comes with memory and performance improvements. If you are running earlier versions of RabbitMQ such as 3.9 or 3.8, we strongly encourage you to upgrade to RabbitMQ 3.10. This can be accomplished with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. We also encourage you to enable automatic minor version upgrades on RabbitMQ 3.10 to help ensure your brokers take advantage of future fixes and improvements in 3.10.</p>
<p><strong>Redis</strong></p>
<p>Amazon ElastiCache now supports AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication access to Redis clusters. By using IAM, you can associate IAM users and roles with ElastiCache for Redis users and manage their cluster access. You can configure IAM authentication by creating an IAM-enabled ElastiCache user and then assigning this user to an appropriate ElastiCache user group via the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK. Using IAM policies, you can grant or revoke cluster access to different IAM identities. Redis applications can now use IAM credentials to authenticate to your ElastiCache clusters while connecting to them.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong></p>
<p>Amazon OpenSearch Service now supports OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards version 2.3. With this version, Amazon OpenSearch Service adds several features such as new algorithms to the machine learning (ML) commons library, improvements to aggregations, improvements to map visualisations, alerting, anomaly detection, and more.</p>
<p>OpenSearch 2.3 uses Lucene 9.1, and the move to the latest version of Lucene offers a number of exciting advancements, and will continue to offer more value in future releases. Some of the improvements in OpenSearch Service that come with OpenSearch 2.3 (includes features that were launched as part OpenSearch versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2) include new ML algorithms that have been added to ML Commons such as Linear regression, Logistic Regression, Localisation, and RCFSummarise, support for Lucene-based k-NN search, and improved Dashboards user experience for anomaly detection. In addition, this release adds support for document-level alerting, support for multi-terms aggregation as part of OpenSearch core, the ability to upload custom GeoJSONs for region map visualisations and better zoom levels (14x), support for searching by relevance using SQL and PPL, centralised management of notifications on Dashboards, and more. For a complete list of new features and improvements, please see the release notes for OpenSearch versions 2.0, 2.1 2.2, and 2.3.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Amplify &amp; Next.js</strong></p>
<p>Announced this week was AWS Amplify Hosting supports Next.js 12 and 13, including middleware, on-demand incremental static regeneration (ISR), and image optimization. With this release, AWS Amplify Hosting offers fully managed CI/CD deployments and hosting for server-side rendered (SSR) apps built using Next.js and static web apps.

<p><strong>SpringBoot</strong></p>
<p>SpringBoot is the most widely used application framework in Java, but did you know you can run your SpringBoot applications on AWS Lambda in as little as 10 minutes without changing a single line of code. In this video James Eastham dives into taking an existing Spring API and deploying that to AWS Lambda in 10 minutes using the AWS Serverless Application Model.</p>
