<meta name="twitter:description" content="July 20th - Instalment #29 Week No.29, and another epic edition packed with lots of great projects and posts, as well as a larger than normal number of case studies this week. Pick of the bunch from me (always hard) is the walkthrough of the CDK Patterns from Matt, the customer case studies and the finala and inframap projects. Remember, if you have a project you want me to mention or talk about, then please reach out."/>

    <h2 id="july-20th---instalment-29">July 20th - Instalment #29</h2>
<p>Week No.29, and another epic edition packed with lots of great projects and posts, as well as a larger than normal number of case studies this week. Pick of the bunch from me (always hard) is the walkthrough of the CDK Patterns from Matt, the customer case studies and the finala and inframap projects. Remember, if you have a project you want me to mention or talk about, then please reach out. I do provide prizes for the ones that I particularly like, so there is also that incentive too.</p>
<p><strong>open source builders</strong></p>
<p>Super excited this week about the Open source builder videos and blog posts that we released late last week. It was a lot of fun talking with Olaf, Alex and Liz, all of whom have featured in past episodes of this newsletter, either because of open source projects they are behind or open source products they have launched.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-source-builders-getting-started/">Part one</a> is all about how they got started in open source, and we follow that up in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-source-builders-lessons-learned/">part two</a> with lessons learnt. Now I have to apologise that there is no video of Liz and this is entirely my fault. During the recording of these sessions, I had a complete fail and whilst I recorded the video, there was no audio. Very sad, as it was an epic session.</p>

<p><strong>AWS CDK for Terraform</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/introducing-the-cloud-development-kit-for-terraform-preview/">Introducing the Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (Preview)</a> - post from Chris Fife and Anubhav Mishra that introduces the developer preview of the Cloud Development Kit for Terraform, or cdktf, that leverage two key technologies of the AWS CDK: the CDK construct programming model, and the javascript interoperability interface, or jsii. <strong>cdktf</strong> lets you define application infrastructure with familiar programming languages, while leveraging the hundreds of providers and thousands of module definitions provided by Terraform and the Terraform community. The CDK for Terraform preview is initially available in TypeScript and Python, with other languages planned in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/0716d9708d321ffb6a00818614779e779925365c/2020/07/14/TerraformPlatform.png" alt="architecture"></p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/cdk-pipelines-continuous-delivery-for-aws-cdk-applications/">CDK Pipelines: Continuous delivery for AWS CDK applications</a> - this post from Rico Huijbers, he announces the Developer Preview release of CDK Pipelines. CDK Pipelines is a high-level construct library that makes it easy to set up a continuous deployment pipeline for your CDK applications, powered by AWS CodePipeline. What are pipelines? A pipeline consists of several stages, which represent logical phases of the deployment. Each stage contains one or more actions that describe what to do in that particular stage. A CDK pipeline starts with several predefined stages and actions, but you can add stages and actions to it to suit the needs of your application.</p>
<p>The post walks you through how to use CDK Pipelines to deploy an AWS Lambda-powered Amazon API Gateway endpoint to two different accounts and you can learn more about how Amazon development teams define application infrastructure in code and deploy it in stages across multiple AWS accounts and Regions, in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/">Amazon Builders’ Library</a> article, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/automating-safe-hands-off-deployments/">Automating safe, hands-off deployments</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/five-things-consider-when-moving-research-workflows-aws">Five things to consider when moving your research workflows to AWS</a> - Dr Tara Madhyastha, Ph.D writes about how research is done differently in the cloud compared to on-premises lab, and what you should be looking at when you are beginning to move computational research to the cloud. It starts with your workflows, which are well-developed sets of computer analyses that turn raw data into results that researchers can publish. Analysis methods can overlap, so workflows vary by lab and project to suit the research question. This post provide some solid guidance on what to think as you begin that migration. Key to much research is the use of HPC computing, so the post covers HPC Parallel Cluster but also talks about some of the open source workflow tools such as <a href="https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow">NextFlow</a>.</p>
