<h3 id="open-distro-for-elasticsearch-110">Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10</h3>
<p><a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/blog/odfe-updates/2020/09/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-1.10.1-is-released/">Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10.1 is now available</a> Viraj Phanse writes about the general availability of the latest release of Open Distro for Elasticsearch, version 1.10.1.</p>
<p>Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.10.1 includes version 7.9.1 of Open Source Elasticsearch and Kibana, plus Apache-2.0-licensed extensions that provide alerting, anomaly detection, index management, performance analysis, security, SQL, and k-NN features. Other components, including ODBC and JDBC drivers, a command-line SQL client, and a command-line performance visualisation tool (“PerfTop”) are also available to download.</p>
<p>From the release highlights, we can see:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Anomaly Detection supports three different types of sample detectors and corresponding indices that allow users to detect sample anomalies using logs related to HTTP response codes, eCommerce orders, and CPU and memory of a host.</li>
<li>The Alerting feature supports email destinations to send notifications without using a web hook.</li>
<li>The updated Kibana Security Plugin streamlines security workflows, improves usability and adds audit and compliance logging configuration.</li>
<li>Anomaly Detection supports a command line interface that allows users to create, start, stop and delete detectors, and work with multiple clusters using named profiles.</li>
<li>K-NN supports warmup API that allows users to explicitly load indices’ graphs used for approximate k-NN search into memory before performing their search workload. With this API, users no longer need to run random queries to prevent initial latency penalties for loading graphs into the cache.</li>

Amazon Timestream is a time series database that makes it easy to collect, store, and process trillions of time series events per day up to 1,000 times faster and at as little as to 1/10th the cost of a relational database. Time series are a very common data format that describes how things change over time. Some of the most common sources are industrial machines and IoT devices, IT infrastructure stacks (such as hardware, software, and networking components), and applications that share their results over time. Time series information is often integrated with open source tools, and in the past I have used tools like Grafana or Kibana to dashboard this data in a way that you can begin to use to provide actionable insights. In this post, Danilo shows how you can integrate this with open source dashboard tools like Grafana, and provides a bunch of open source tools to get you going. GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-timestream-tools">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/09/25/amazon-timestream-plugin-grafana-1024x568.png" alt="dashbiard"></p>
<p><a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2020/09/30/now-you-can-add-amazon-timestream-to-your-grafana-observability-dashboard/">Now you can add Amazon Timestream to your Grafana observability dashboard</a> post from Julie Dam at Grafana Labs provides some more details and sample dashboards.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Spark</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/running-on-demand-serverless-apache-spark-data-processing-jobs-using-amazon-sagemaker-managed-spark-containers-and-the-amazon-sagemaker-sdk/">Running on-demand, serverless Apache Spark data processing jobs using Amazon SageMaker managed Spark containers and the Amazon SageMaker SDK</a>  Shreyas Subramanian, Andrew Packer, and Vidhi Kastuar win the prize for longest blog post title this week, but don&rsquo;t worry, the post is just the right size to show you how you can use Spark containers within Amazon SageMaker for data preparation, training models and running model inference. They share how you can take advantage of the built-in Spark container on Amazon SageMaker to focus on more important aspects of preparing and preprocessing data instead of spending time tuning, scaling, or managing Spark infrastructure, developers can focus on core implementation.</p>
<p><strong>BERT</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/bert-inference-on-g4-instances-using-apache-mxnet-and-gluonnlp-1-million-requests-for-20-cents/">BERT inference on G4 instances using Apache MXNet and GluonNLP: 1 million requests for 20 cents</a> this collaboration from Moises Hernandez Fernandez, Anish Mohan, Haibin Lin, and Przemyslaw Tredak will help you understand how to architect an efficient solution for performing BERT inference tasks on EC2 G4 GPU instances, showing MXNet optimizations that boost GPU performance that can achieve speeds up to twice as fast in both question answering and classification tasks. They go onto show how g4dn.xlarge instances offer lower latency than EC2 CPU instance, and how g4dn.xlarge is 3.8 times better than c5.24xlarge on average. When it comes to optimisation of your production models, then this is a must read post.</p>
<p><strong>Altimeter</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/graph-your-aws-resources-with-amazon-neptune/">Graph your AWS resources with Amazon Neptune</a> by Dave Bechberger shows you how you can use Altimeter, an open-source project from Tableau Software, LLC that scans AWS resources and links these resources into a graph which you can then store, query, and visualize in Amazon Neptune. You can query the graph to examine the AWS resources and their relationships in your AWS account, so for example, you can query for resources or pathways that expose a cluster with a public IP address to check for security and compliance.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/observations-on-arm64-awss-amazon-ec2-m6g-instances/">Observations on ARM64 &amp; AWS’s Amazon EC2 M6g Instances</a> this post from By Liz Fong-Jones at <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/why-honeycomb/">Honeycomb.io</a> is my favourite post this week and is a takedown of how engineering teams can start looking at AWS Graviton2 processor architecture to start looking at the impact of recompiling their software might be able to achieve. I don&rsquo;t want to give any spoilers otherwise you will not read the post, but you will not be surprised to hear that they give it the big thumbs up. In this post they talk about the process of testing on this architecture including the need to re-compile many open source tools and software projects. The good news though, the overall work only took them a few weeks. So read on and then ask yourself what could you do with AWS Graviton2 instance types&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>AWS AppSync</strong></p>
<p>You can now enable AWS WAF integration for your GraphQL APIs in AWS AppSync, making it easier to protect your APIs against common web exploits. AWS AppSync is a managed GraphQL service that simplifies application development by letting you create a flexible API to securely access, manipulate, and combine data from one or more data sources with less network calls. With AppSync, you can build scalable applications, including those requiring real-time updates, on a range of data sources such as NoSQL data stores, relational databases, HTTP APIs, and your custom data sources with AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps to protect your web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over which traffic to allow or block to your web applications by defining customisable web security rules. To learn more visit the product page here.</p>
<p>You can use AWS WAF to protect your AppSync GraphQL APIs against attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). AWS WAF gives you the flexibility to define rule statements anywhere within the web request, such as HTTP headers or body, allowing you to filter requests based on IP address, country, field size length, requests, and/or strings or regular expression patterns. You can also implement rate-based rules, which can be used to slow down brute force attacks and limit API usage based on IP addresses. Furthermore, AWS Managed Rules for AWS WAF help you protect your applications without the need to create or manage the rules directly.</p>
<p>Read the blog post here, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/appsync-waf/">AppSync adds support for AWS WAF</a></p>
<p><strong>SQL Server on Linux</strong></p>
<p>With AWS Launch Wizard, you can now easily deploy SQL Server Always On availability groups on Ubuntu Server, making it easier for you to run SQL Server workloads on free Linux-based operating systems, without the need to buy Windows Server licenses. AWS Launch Wizard offers a guided way of sizing, configuring, and deploying AWS resources for third party applications, such as Microsoft SQL Server Always On and HANA-based SAP systems, without the need to manually identify and provision individual AWS resources. Previously, customers could use AWS Launch Wizard to easily perform SQL Server Always On deployments on Windows Server. Now, you are able to leverage the same ease of use to perform SQL Server Always On deployments on Linux and save Windows Server licensing costs.</p>
