    <h1>AWS open source news and updates No. 28</h1>
    <h2 id="july-13th---instalment-28">July 13th - Instalment #28</h2>
<p>Week No.28, and this week we have another fantastic  collection of open source posts covering robotics, containers, serverless, machine learning and more. I cover a number of projects you can get stuck into, including robotics projects and resources, a continuous machine learning project posts and the usual collection of indispensable projects that you will wonder how you ever managed without. Finally there are some events you might want to put in your diary.</p>
<p>Remember, if you have a project you want me to mention or talk about, then please reach out. I do provide prizes for the ones that I particularly like, so there is also that incentive too.</p>
<p>Super excited this week about the Open source builder videos and blog posts that we released late last week. It was a lot of fun talking with Olaf, Alex and Liz, all of whom have featured in past episodes of this newsletter, either because of open source projects they are behind or open source products they have launched.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-source-builders-getting-started/">Part one</a> is all about how they got started in open source, and we follow that up in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/open-source-builders-lessons-learned/">part two</a> with lessons learnt. Now I have to apologise that there is no video of Liz and this is entirely my fault. During the recording of these sessions, I had a complete fail and whilst I recorded the video, there was no audio. Very sad, as it was an epic session.</p>
<p>{% youtube b6arpt3l7yM %}</p>
<p>If you want to take part then please contact me as I am currently organising recording of the next batch.</p>

<p><strong>AWS RoboMaker and Amazon S3 rosbag extensions</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/robotics/record-store-robot-data-rosbag/">Easily record and store robotic application data with the S3 rosbag cloud extension for AWS RoboMaker</a> this post from Vamshi Konduri and Miaofei introduces a set of new ROS nodes that developers, QA engineers and fleet managers can use to debug, test, and develop features for their robots. The post talks about the new S3 rosbag cloud extension that enables customers to easily configure and record data from robots as rosbags, and upload them to Amazon S3, which they can later use to analyze events, troubleshoot existing applications, and provide as inputs to AWS RoboMaker log-based simulation for regression. This post looks at three ROSnodes in the S3 rosbag cloud extension that create and upload rosbag files from the robot to Amazon S3, and gives you some hands-on examples of how to us the nodes.</p>
<p><strong>cdk8s+</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-cdk8s-intent-driven-apis-for-kubernetes-objects/">Introducing cdk8s+: Intent-driven APIs for Kubernetes objects</a> this post from  Eli Polonsky and Elad Ben-Israel talks about the many options you have to define Kubernetes applications via code, including the recent launch of cdk8s an open-source project that enables you to use general purpose programming languages to synthesize manifests. This post talks about the next step for cdk8s, not surprisingly called cdk8s+. cdk8s+ is a library built on top of cdk8s and provides a rich, intent-based class library for using the core Kubernetes API. It includes hand crafted constructs that map to native Kubernetes objects, and expose a richer API with reduced complexity.</p>
<p>The post then walks you through deploying a sample application and looks at the different approaches you have. This was the best part of this post, and I think you will like how you can use much of the thinking as you approach how you automate the deployment of your applications.</p>

<p><strong>Introducing Amazon EMR Managed Scaling</strong></p>
<p>This post discussed EMR Managed Scaling, which automatically resizes your cluster for best performance at the lowest possible cost. This is a new feature that automatically resizes your cluster for best performance at the lowest possible cost. With EMR Managed Scaling you specify the minimum and maximum compute limits for your clusters and Amazon EMR automatically resizes them for best performance and resource utilization. EMR Managed Scaling continuously samples key metrics associated with the workloads running on clusters. EMR Managed Scaling is supported for Apache Spark, Apache Hive and YARN-based workloads on Amazon EMR versions 5.30.1 and above. Read the full post here, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/introducing-amazon-emr-managed-scaling-automatically-resize-clusters-to-lower-cost/">Introducing Amazon EMR Managed Scaling – Automatically Resize Clusters to Lower Cost</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Keyspaces point-in-time-recovery (PITR)</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra), a scalable, highly available, and fully managed Apache Cassandra–compatible database service, now enables you to back up your table data continuously by using point-in-time recovery (PITR).</p>
<p>PITR provides you with continuous backups of your Amazon Keyspaces table data to help you protect against accidental writes or deletes. When you enable PITR, Amazon Keyspaces backs up your table data automatically with per-second granularity. You can restore your table data to any second in time in the preceding 35 days. You can enable PITR with a single click in the AWS Management Console or with a simple Cassandra Query Language (CQL) API call. Using PITR, you can back up tables with hundreds of terabytes of data, with no impact on the performance or availability of your production applications. You also can use PITR to recover Amazon Keyspaces table deleted in the preceding 35 days that had PITR enabled, and restore the table to its state just before it was deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon FSx for Lustre Now Supports AWS Graviton2-based Instances</strong></p>
<p>Amazon FSx for Lustre now enables you to use the open source and popular high-performance file system from Amazon EC2 instances powered by Arm-based AWS Graviton2 processors. This capability makes it easier and even more cost-effective to run workloads where speed matters, such as machine learning, gaming, electronic design automation, high-performance computing, video processing, and financial modeling.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EMR and Customer-managed CMKs in AWS Key Management Service (KMS)</strong></p>
<p>Amazon EMR now supports encrypting log files using Customer-managed Customer master keys (CMKs) stored in AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Amazon EMR automatically upload log files to Amazon S3 when logging and debugging is enabled With this new feature, you can associate Customer managed CMKs in AWS KMS when launching a cluster. Amazon EMR will automatically encrypt logs using the Customer managed CMKs in AWS KMS. Previously you could only encrypt log files written to S3 using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3). Click here to learn more about encrypting log files please see the documentation. Log encryption using customer managed CMKs is available in EMR version 5.30, in all regions where EMR is available</p>
