    <h1>AWS open source newsletter #169</h1>
    <h2 id="august-14th-2023---instalment-169">August 14th, 2023 - Instalment #169</h2>
<p>Welcome to #169 of the AWS open source newsletter, featuring the latest and greatest open source news, projects, videos, and community content that you need to know about. Featured in this weeks edition we have more great projects, including a new ODBC driver for Amazon Timestream database, a nice tool to simplify your ssh tunnelling, an essential VSCode extension for working with Cedar policies, a couple of projects that help you shift left and validate / monitor your policies, a solution to help you monitor your Apache Kafka environments, as well as some great sample applications.</p>
<p>If that was not enough, then you can immerse yourself into the written and video content produced by the AWS community, which this week features open source technologies such as Firecracker, OpenSearch, AWS CDK, Juypter AI, dbt, Apache Airflow, Cedar, cfnguard, Grafana, Prometheus, Apache Kafka, Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework, AWS Lambda Web Adapter, Smithy, Apache Spark, AWS ParallelCluster, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot, Kubernetes, Mountpoint for Amazon S3, MySQL, Lustre, OpenZFS, Redis, Karpenter, Seekable OCI (SOCI), and more.</p>
<p>I have added more events to the calendar, and if you are in London this week, make sure to check out the AWS User Group that is happening later on this week.</p>
<p><strong>Do you use the AWS SAM CLI with Homebrew?</strong></p>
<p>If you are a user of the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) command line interface tool, and have been using Homebrew to install this (I guess this will mostly be Mac users, although some might also be using this on Linux) then you should be aware of this notice that appeared on the <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/35a">SAM CLI documentation page here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE!</strong>
Starting September 2023, AWS will no longer maintain the Homebrew installer for the AWS SAM CLI (aws/tap/aws-sam-cli). To continue using Homebrew, you can use the community managed installer (aws-sam-cli) at your discretion. Any Homebrew command that references aws/tap/aws-sam-cli will redirect to aws-sam-cli.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check out the page for details of the alternative methods for installing and updating the SAM CLI.</p>

<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p><strong>farssh</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/358">farssh</a> provides secure on-demand connections into AWS VPCs. Using this tool you can easily connect to in-VPC resources like RDS and OpenSearch endpoints, using tools installed on your local machine. FarSSH features a SOCKS proxy mode, enabling your browser to be &ldquo;in&rdquo; the target VPC; this works both for accessing VPC resources and as a quick way to tunnel all your browser traffic, so your browser&rsquo;s connections will appear to come from this AWS region&rsquo;s public IP addresses (like a VPN). Check out the README for additional information on how much using this tool might cost.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4f422be222fc5fd492b96f7c82ecbe9df060cb70fa8e5ecf30d6cbfaaa639b89/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f467a3737367a6f57494149366638393f666f726d61743d706e67266e616d653d39303078393030" alt="overview of how farssh works"></p>

The ODBC driver is available under the Apache-2.0 license.</p>
<p><strong>vscode-cedar</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34x">vscode-cedar</a> is the Cedar policy language extension for Visual Studio Code supports syntax highlighting, formatting, and validation. You might have seen me using this in my demos of the TinyToDo Cedar example app, so I am super happy this VSCode extension is now available on the VSCode Marketplace. Check the README that shows how you can configure the plugin, which was the only thing I needed to tweak for my setup. If you are using or experimenting with Cedar, make sure you check this out.</p>
<p><strong>cnappgoat</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34y">cnappgoat</a> is an open source vulnerable-by-design environment deployment tool specifically engineered to facilitate practice arenas for defenders and pen testers. Its main function is to deploy intentionally vulnerable environments across multiple cloud service providers, to help you sharpen your skills in exploiting, detecting, and preventing such vulnerabilities. Make sure you read through the README carefully, it provides examples of how to get started. I also liked how the project acknowledges other similar related open source projects (some of which I have featured in this newsletter).</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ermetic-research/cnappgoat/main/images/demo.gif" alt="demo screenshot of cnappgoat"></p>
<p><strong>validate-policy</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/346">validate-policy</a> this project creates Lambda function that automatically validates policy document defined when a policy or role is created or updated. Use cases include be notified when a policy contains error or security warnings. For example, when it is created via infrastructure as code (IaC). Be aware though, that the resources are created or updated in the region where the CloudFormation stack is created.</p>

<h3 id="aws-and-community-blog-posts">AWS and Community blog posts</h3>
<p><strong>Community round up</strong></p>
<p>I like to start each newsletter with a round up of what community posts caught my eye, and as always, this week we have some great reads. Starting off with Matthew Bonig&rsquo;s post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34r">Announcing my Advanced CDK Course</a>, is a short post where Matt shares an new CDK training course which he has put together. Matt starts off with a fantastic opening which I urge everyone to check out, it is always nice when someone shares their origin story like Matt does. Following that is Nathan Fries with this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34s">Neural Search Quickstart for OpenSearch</a>. Nathan provides a very nice guided post to help you understand the basics of the Neural Search feature within OpenSearch, and whether or not it would be useful for your applications. This is another must read this week, great stuff. Richard Elberger has put together <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34t">Three key factors in choosing a real-time operating system (RTOS)</a> which is essential reading if you are currently looking at realtime operating systems in the IoT space.</p>
<p>With Generative AI tools like AWS CodeWhisperer helping developers create code faster, it is nice to see that data scientists can now use similar tools to help them in their Juypter notebooks. Jason Weill writes about a new plugin in his post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34u">Generative AI in Jupyter</a>. Jupyter AI is an official subproject of Project Jupyter, that provides a user-friendly and powerful way to explore generative AI models in notebooks and improve your productivity in JupyterLab and the Jupyter Notebook. It features a native chat UI in JupyterLab that enables you to work with generative AI as a conversational assistant. It support for a wide range of generative model providers and models (AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, OpenAI, SageMaker, and more). Read the post for more details including a walk through.</p>
<p>The last post featured in this round up is from Alex Driedger over at Hootsuite. Alex writes, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34v">Automating DBT + Airflow</a> and shares why they chose dbt and provide details on how they use this, running DBT core on AWS Fargate.</p>
<p><strong>Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)</strong></p>
<p>The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework is an open-source project, delivering an extensible framework for developing schemas, along with a vendor-agnostic core security schema. Vendors and other data producers can adopt and extend the schema for their specific domains. Data engineers can map differing schemas to help security teams simplify data ingestion and normalisation, so that data scientists and analysts can work with a common language for threat detection and investigation. The goal is to provide an open standard, adopted in any environment, application, or solution, while complementing existing security standards and processes. In <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34h">Celebrating One Year of OCSF: Simplifying Security Telemetry for a Stronger Defense</a> Jon Ramsey and Keith Gilbert provide a retrospective over the past year and share how <em><strong>&quot;&hellip;By investing in open source initiatives, we’re helping to ensure that the projects and technologies that we, our customers, and the world depend on remain secure and reliable for the long term&hellip;&quot;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong></p>
<p>In <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34i">Configure SAML federation for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless with Okta</a> Aish Gunasekar and Prashant Agrawal provide a hands on guide on how to use Okta as your IdP and integrate it with OpenSearch Serverless to securely manage your users and groups for secure access to your data.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2023/08/02/bdb3208-architecture-1.png" alt="overview of user authentication journey for okta and opensearch"></p>
<p><strong>AWS Lambda Web Adapter</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2jv">AWS Lambda Web Adapter</a>, is an open source project written in Rust that I featured when it was first published in <a href="https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-146-26bh">#146</a>. The project serves as a universal adapter for Lambda Runtime API and HTTP API. It allows developers to package familiar HTTP 1.1/1.0 web applications, such as Express.js, Next.js, Flask, SpringBoot, or Laravel, and deploy them on AWS Lambda. In the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34m">Using response streaming with AWS Lambda Web Adapter to optimize performance</a>, Harold Sun, Xue Jiaqing, and Su Jie show you how developers can more easily package web applications that support Lambda response streaming, enhancing the user experience and performance metrics of their web applications. What is Lambda response streaming?  Lambda response streaming, which introduces a new invocation mode accessible through the Lambda Function URLs. This feature enables Lambda functions to send response content in sequential chunks to the client. [hands on]</p>

<p><strong>Smithy</strong></p>
<p>Last week we shared the repo for <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/33z">Smithy for Python</a>, and this week I am happy to share the official blog post from Jordon Phillips, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34p">Introducing Smithy for Python</a> that looks more closely at this project and shows how you can get started.</p>

<p><strong>Data on EKS</strong></p>
<p>AWS Trainium is an advanced ML accelerator that transforms high-performance deep learning(DL) training. Trn1 instances, powered by AWS Trainium chips, are purpose-built for high-performance DL training of 100B+ parameter models. In this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34z">AWS Trainium on EKS</a> you will be guided in how to securely deploy an Amazon EKS Cluster with Trainium Node groups (Trn1.32xlarge and Trn1n.32xlarge) and all the required plugins(EFA Package for EC2, Neuron Device K8s Plugin and EFA K8s plugin). Once the deployment is complete, we will learn how to train a BERT-large(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model with Distributed PyTorch pre-training using the WikiCorpus dataset. For scheduling the distributed training job, we will utilize TorchX with the Volcano Scheduler. Additionally, we can monitor the neuron activity during training using neuron-top.</p>

<p><strong>Mountpoint for Amazon S3</strong></p>
<p>Last week we announced the general availability of Mountpoint for Amazon S3, a new open source file client that delivers high-throughput access to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), lowering processing times and compute costs for data lake applications. Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is a file client that translates local file system API calls to S3 object API calls such as GET and PUT.</p>
<p>Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is ideal for workloads that read large datasets (terabytes to petabytes in size) and require the elasticity and high throughput of Amazon S3. Common use cases include machine learning training as well as reprocessing and validation in autonomous vehicle data processing. These workloads read large datasets over several compute instances and write sequentially to a file from a single process or thread. Mountpoint for Amazon S3 supports sequential and random read operations on existing files and sequential write operations for creating new files.</p>
<p>My colleague Jeff Bar put together a great walk through that looks at a fun example of how you can use this in his post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34d">Mountpoint for Amazon S3 – Generally Available and Ready for Production Workloads</a>. It&rsquo;s ferry good! (sorry, regular readers know that I cannot resist a good opportunity for a pun!)</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/08/07/ferry.gif" alt="ferry traffic example showing how you can use mountpoint for amazon s3"></p>
<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL now supports MySQL minor versions 5.7.43 and 8.0.34. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of MySQL, and to benefit from the bug fixes, performance improvements, and new functionality added by the MySQL community.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong></p>
<p>You can now use Terraform to help you with your Amazon OpenSearch Serverless deployments. OpenSearch Serverless is the serverless option for Amazon OpenSearch Service that makes it easier for you to run search and analytics workloads without having to think about infrastructure management. Terraform enables OpenSearch Serverless deployments as infrastructure as code(IaC). Using Terraform for deployments, you can ensure that the configurations are measured and validated, minimising the chances of errors caused by human oversight.</p>
<p><strong>Lustre</strong></p>
<p>Amazon FSx for Lustre, a fully managed service that makes it easy and cost effective to launch, run, and scale the world’s most popular high-performance file system, now supports the ability to free up storage capacity on an FSx file system that has data synchronised with Amazon S3. FSx for Lustre integrates natively with Amazon S3, synchronising changes in both directions with automatic import and export, so that you can access your S3 data lakes through a high-performance POSIX-compliant ﬁle system on demand. Starting today, you can use the FSx API to release inactive data that is on the file system and has already been exported to S3. You can choose to only release data from files that have not been accessed for a minimum amount of time and to only release data within a specified directory path. When a file is released, the file data is removed from your file system (and retained on S3) and the metadata remains on your file system. If a user or application accesses a released file, the data is automatically and transparently loaded back onto your file system from your S3 bucket. To release data on a regular interval, you can schedule the FSx API using Amazon EventBridge.</p>
<p>Find out more by reading <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34e">New — File Release for Amazon FSx for Lustre</a>, where my colleague Veliswa Boya shows you this new capability in action.</p>
<p><strong>OpenZFS</strong></p>
<p>Amazon FSx for OpenZFS provides fully managed, cost-effective, shared file storage powered by the popular OpenZFS file system, and is designed to deliver sub-millisecond latencies and up to 10 GB/s of throughput along with rich ZFS-powered data management capabilities (like snapshots, data cloning, and compression).</p>
<p>You can now use a Multi-AZ deployment option when creating file systems on Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, making it easy to deploy file storage that spans multiple AWS Availability Zones (AZs) to support business-critical workloads that require high availability and enhanced durability. The new Multi-AZ file systems are built with a high-availability pair of file servers (active/passive file servers) spread across AZs. They’re configured to synchronously replicate data across AZs to provide enhanced durability, and are designed to automatically fail over between file servers to provide continuous availability to data in the event that the active file server or even an entire AZ becomes unavailable. With this launch, customers can leverage the power, agility, and simplicity of Amazon FSx for OpenZFS for a broader set of workloads, including business-critical workloads like database, line-of-business (e.g., core banking, retail platforms, semiconductor chip design), and web-serving applications that require highly available shared storage that spans multiple AZs.</p>
<p><strong>Redis</strong></p>
<p>Amazon ElastiCache for Redis now supports online migration from self-managed Redis clusters to ElastiCache for Redis clusters running in cluster mode. Online migration simplifies moving data from self-managed Redis clusters to ElastiCache with minimal application disruption. During the migration, ElastiCache replicates cache data from each self-managed Redis source shard to the target ElastiCache cluster. Once initial replication is complete, the two clusters will be kept in sync until you are ready to update your application configuration to use ElastiCache. ElastiCache for Redis online migration is supported for target clusters running ElastiCache for Redis version 5.0.6 and above.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong></p>
<p>EMR Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it easy for data scientists and data engineers to develop, visualise, and debug data engineering and data science applications written in R, Python, Scala, and PySpark. EMR Studio provides fully managed Jupyter Notebooks and tools such as Spark UI and YARN Timeline Service.</p>
<p>EMR Studio workspaces now supports applying fine-grained data access control with AWS Lake Formation when accessing data through EMR on EC2 clusters. When you connect to EMR clusters from EMR Studio workspaces, you can now choose the IAM role (called runtime IAM Role) that you want to connect with. Apache Spark interactive notebooks will access only the data and resources permitted by policies attached to this runtime role. When data is accessed from data lakes managed with AWS Lake Formation, you can enforce table and column-level access using policies attached to this runtime role. With this new capability, multiple users can connect to the same EMR cluster from their EMR Studio workspaces, each using a runtime role scoped with customised data access permissions. User sessions are completely isolated from one another on the shared cluster. This can also simplify provisioning of EMR clusters for interactive use cases, thus reducing operational overhead and saving costs.</p>

<p><strong>AWS User Group UK Meetup #61</strong>
<strong>London, August 16th</strong></p>
<p>AWS User groups regularly meet across the world, and in this London chapter of the AWS User group, Matt Carey will be sharing his talk <em>&ldquo;Building a Viral Open Source AI Chatbot: A Journey from Concept to Reality&rdquo;</em>. From the extract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Learn how we built Quivr - the open-source virtual brain. In 2.5 months we achieved 8k active users of the demo app and a whopping 18k stars on GitHub. We were number 1 on the GitHub trending page for multiple days in a row.
This is the story of how Quivr went viral and how our tiny dev team struggled to build all the features our user base wanted. We will talk about the challenges we faced scaling a generative AI-powered app without it costing the earth on ECS Fargate, and the extra tooling we had to build along the way.
We will cover how we solved the problems of keeping the project open source and super easy to both use and contribute whilst leveraging AWS services in a different way to most.&rdquo;</p>
