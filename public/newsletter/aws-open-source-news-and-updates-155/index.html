<h3 id="celebrating-open-source-contributors">Celebrating open source contributors</h3>
<p>The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created.</p>
<p>So thank you to the following open source heroes: Jeff Boudier, Philipp Schmidd, Julien Simon, Bob Tordella,  Cícero Joasyo Mateus de Moura, Dipankar Mazumdar, Hayden Baker, Lin Wang, Charlie Yang, Nate Archer, Vikram Sahadevan, Suvendu Kumar Patra, Ranjit Rajan, Alexandre Rezende, Kannan Iyer, Spot Callaway, Mark Sailes, and Lars Jacobsson.</p>
<h3 id="latest-open-source-projects">Latest open source projects</h3>
<p><em>The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.</em></p>
<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p><strong>iam-access-key-report</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r0">iam-access-key-report</a> This is a simple tool written in python that will enumerate data about all active IAM access keys across an AWS Organization and will enrich each key with account tag information. The output of the tool is a CSV file that can then be filtered based on the tag information associated with the keys. This allow us to focus on access keys that are used in things like &lsquo;Environment:Production&rsquo; accounts or in accounts that are labelled with &lsquo;DataClassification:Restricted&rsquo;. In addition, the tool performs some basic security checks of the IAM policies of the user accounts the access keys are attached to. It will tell you if a key has administrative permissions or is able to read your data in Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and Amazon DynamoDB.</p>
<p><strong>iambic</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2rk">iambic</a> is an open source project that helps you manage your IAM policies as &ldquo;code&rdquo;, allowing you to model your permissions and then store these in source control.  The project states it is &ldquo;the Terraform of Cloud IAM&rdquo;. It certain is feature rich, has good documentation with plenty of examples, and works across other public Cloud providers. The repo states this is still a beta project, so bear that in mind. (hat tip to Corey Quinn&rsquo;s Last Week in AWS newsletter for bring this repo to my attention)</p>
<p><strong>aws-cloudformation-controller-for-flux</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r1">aws-cloudformation-controller-for-flux</a> helps you to store CloudFormation templates in a git repository and automatically sync template changes to CloudFormation stacks in your AWS account with Flux. The AWS CloudFormation Template Sync Controller for Flux is an extension to Flux that lets you store your CloudFormation templates in a Git repository and automatically deploy them as CloudFormation stacks in your AWS account. After installing the CloudFormation Template Sync controller into your Kubernetes cluster, you can configure Flux to monitor your Git repository for changes to CloudFormation template files. When a CloudFormation template file is updated in a Git commit, the CloudFormation controller is designed to automatically deploy the latest template changes to your CloudFormation stack. The CloudFormation controller is also designed to continuously sync the latest template from the Git repository into your stack by re-deploying the template on a regular interval.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-controller-for-flux/blob/main/docs/demo.gif?raw=true" alt="demo screenshot of aws-cloudformation-controller-for-flux working"></p>
<p><strong>threat-composer</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r2">threat-composer</a> if you ask any Amazonian about what is the most important job developers do, there is a good chance they will say security. threat-composer is an open source tool that aims to help you brainstorm and consistently compose useful threats to help you with your security planning. From the README:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A key phase of the threat modeling process is the &ldquo;What can go wrong?&rdquo; step. Feedback we received is that there are two key challenges in this step, firstly there is little industry guidance on what a &lsquo;good&rsquo; threat statement looks like; Secondly, no canonical list of possible things that can wrong hence it necessitates brainstorming and collaboration between the individuals involved in the threat modeling process often starting from a &ldquo;blank page&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>threat-composer aims to provide prescriptive and flexible threat statement structure that allows a user to create a structured threat statement by supplying their own contextual input into the structure, whilst meeting them where they are by allowing them to start from any input that they desire. The tool encourages the user to be more complete and descriptive to help ensure the threat statement allows for both for prioritisation for mitigation and sufficient information to devise mitigation strategies. In addition, the tools aims to aid the brainstorming and collaboration process by including full threat statement examples and per field examples which a customer can use as inspiration or as a starting point for their own custom and contextual threat statements.</p>
<p><strong>personalize-kafka-connector</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r3">personalize-kafka-connector</a> Amazon Personalize is a fully managed machine learning service that uses your data to generate item recommendations for your users. When you import data, you can choose to import records in bulk, or with our real-time APIs. For customers that use Kafka, we&rsquo;ve set up the Amazon Personalize Kafka Connector to send real-time data from Kafka topics to your Amazon Personalize Dataset.</p>
<p><strong>automated-security-helper-pipeline</strong>
<a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r4">automated-security-helper-pipeline</a> this repo helps you deploy <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1td">The Automated Security Helper (ASH)</a> a project we featured in <a href="https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-news-and-updates-117-16l1">#117</a> last year. It deploys a pipeline CDK template, which can be used to provision an end to end pipeline using CodePipeline, CodeCommit and CodeBuild. The solution will scan new commits using ASH, will save the report into S3 bucket, and will alert to SecurityHub if the scan failed.</p>

<p><strong>cdk-integ-tests-sample</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r5">cdk-integ-tests-sample</a> this example repo demonstrates how to write integration tests for your CDK applications using the AWS CDK integ-test CDK construct and integ-runner CLI Tool. The example application is a serverless data enrichment application with persistence shown in Figure 1. CDK integration tests are written for this application under the integ-tests/ folder. When these tests are run, it creates a separate integration test stack (a copy of your operational application) and runs the test against this isolated environment.</p>

<p><strong>service-catalog-engine-for-terraform-os</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r6">service-catalog-engine-for-terraform-os</a> this repo, the AWS Service Catalog Terraform Reference Engine (TRE),  provides an example for you to configure and install a Terraform open source engine in your AWS Service Catalog administrator account. With the engine installed into your account, you can use Service Catalog as a single tool to organise, govern, and distribute your Terraform configurations within AWS. Dive into the detailed README to find out more about how this works and the underlying architecture. You can also read the blog post by my colleague Danillo, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2og">New – Self-Service Provisioning of Terraform Open-Source Configurations with AWS Service Catalog</a>, that will help you get started.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/26/service-catalog-terraform-product-details-1024x933.png" alt="screenshot of console integration of service catalog for terraform"></p>
<h3 id="workshops-and-hands-on-labs">Workshops and Hands on Labs</h3>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2rl">Fast-Terraform</a> this repo is a great resource learning how to get started with Terraform on AWS, and has a number of different labs covering various AWS services. If you are using this, or try it out, let me know how you get on.</p>
<h3 id="aws-and-community-blog-posts">AWS and Community blog posts</h3>
<p><strong>Community roundup</strong></p>
<p>We had a great selection of community authored content that caught my eye this week.</p>
<p>First up is the latest post from AWS Community Builder Bob Tordella at Steampipe. I always enjoy reading Bob&rsquo;s posts, and in <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r7">Accelerate your AWS Well-Architected assessments with Steampipe</a> he touches upon a growing movement around using open source tools to help with automating activities of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.  In this post, he talks about how Steampipe can help accelerate assessments, get deep insights into your environments, and provide tailored recommendations based on the Well-Architected Framework. Another great read from Bob &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on Fire&rdquo; was <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2ra">Visualizing AWS EKS Kubernetes Clusters with Relationship Graphs</a> where he shows a different use case for Steampipe, this time providing visualisations that provide quick context and highlight important information about your resources, in this case AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters. Very nice indeed.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed reading AWS Community Builder&rsquo;s Cícero Joasyo Mateus de Moura&rsquo;s post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r8">Data Quality at Scale with Great Expectations, Spark, and Airflow on EMR</a> as Data Quality is a hot topic, and I have been meaning to get my hands on Great Expectations so I found this a great post to understand it a little more. The fact it also incorporates my favourite open source project has nothing to do with how much I liked it! Go and read this post, you will not regret it.</p>
<p>Dipankar Mazumdar has put together this blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r9">Building a Streamlit app on a Lakehouse using Apache Iceberg &amp; DuckDB</a> which continues an ongoing number of posts featuring Streamlit, an open source project that makes it easier to build data based applications. In this post, Dipankar provides a hands on guide on building a Streamlit application on top of a data lakehouse built on top of the Apache Iceberg table format.</p>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*DdWXnvyRqhrdcTpj-jfAfw.png" alt="overview of lakehouse blog post visualisation"></p>
<p><strong>Smithy</strong></p>
<p>Smithy is an open-source Interface Definition Language (IDL) for web services created by AWS. AWS uses Smithy to model services, generate server scaffolding and rich clients in multiple languages, and generate the AWS SDKs. Last week the team behind Smithy launched the Smith CLI, and Hayden Baker put together this post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2rn">Introducing the Smithy CLI</a>, that provides a hands on guide on how to get started with it.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong></p>
<p>In the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2rb">You can now see ML model status in OpenSearch Dashboards</a> Lin Wang, Charlie Yang, and Nate Archer huddle together to write about the first piece of ML functionality in OpenSearch Dashboards, the deployed models dashboard. This is an experimental feature that gives you a view into the responsiveness of each deployed model on each ML node in your cluster. Very cool.</p>
<p><img src="https://opensearch.org/assets/media/blog-images/2023-04-10-ml-deployment-status/ml-model-status.png" alt="overview of opensearch ml dashboards"></p>
<p><strong>Apache Iceberg</strong></p>
<p>Vikram Sahadevan and Suvendu Kumar Patra have put together this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2ri">Build a transactional data lake using Apache Iceberg, AWS Glue, and cross-account data shares using AWS Lake Formation and Amazon Athena</a> that shows you how to configure AWS Lake Formation using Iceberg table formats.  The post goes onto explain how to upsert and merge in an S3 data lake using an Iceberg framework and apply Lake Formation access control using Athena. [hands on]</p>

<p><strong>Securing Open Source</strong></p>
<p>My colleague Spot put together this fine post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2rg">Securing PyPI for the Future</a> that dives deep into how we at AWS are investing to support open source software supply chain security. In this instance, it explores how we are working with the Python community and PyPi to keep PyPI secure for the benefit of all its users.</p>
<p>Amir Montazery, who is the managing director for Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) also <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2rj">tweeted</a> last week about how we collaborated with the SimpleJSON project on an independent review.</p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon Corretto</strong></p>
<p>AWS Lambda now supports Java 17 as both a managed runtime and a container base image. Developers creating serverless applications in Lambda with Java 17 can take advantage of new language features including Java records, sealed classes and multi-line strings. The Lambda Java 17 runtime also has numerous performance improvements, including optimisations when running Lambda functions on Graviton 2 processors. It supports AWS Lambda Snap Start (in supported Regions) for fast cold starts, and the latest versions of the popular Spring Boot 3 and Micronaut 4 application frameworks. For more information on Lambda’s support for Java 17, see our blog post at Java 17 runtime now available in AWS Lambda. This runtime is based on the AWS Corretto distribution of OpenJDK. AWS will automatically apply updates to the Java 17 managed runtime and to the AWS-provided Java 17 base image, as they become available.</p>
<p>Make sure to read the launch post from Mark Sailes, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2rm">AWS Lambda now supports Java 17</a></p>
<p><strong>RabbitMQ</strong></p>
<p>Amazon MQ now provides support for RabbitMQ version 3.10.20 and RabbitMQ 3.9.27, which include several important fixes and performance optimisations to the previously supported versions. Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for Apache ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ that makes it easier to set up and operate message brokers on AWS. You can reduce your operational burden by using Amazon MQ to manage the provisioning, setup, and maintenance of message brokers. Because Amazon MQ connects to your current applications with industry-standard APIs and protocols, you can more easily migrate to AWS without having to rewrite code. If you are running a version of RabbitMQ earlier than 3.10.20 or 3.9.27, we encourage you to upgrade to the latest versions to get access to the latest security, performance and feature enhancements. This can be accomplished with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. If your broker has automatic minor versions upgrade enabled and is currently running version 3.10.10 or 3.10.17, Amazon MQ will automatically upgrade the broker to version 3.10.20 during a future maintenance window.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Cassandra</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra), a scalable, serverless, highly available, and fully managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service, now supports the use of the IN operator in SELECT queries of Cassandra Query Language (CQL). Last week we announced that Amazon Keyspaces has now added support for the IN operator in CQL SELECT queries. This support allows Cassandra developers to write queries that are less complex and more compatible with Cassandra. Additionally, support for the IN operator in SELECT queries provides an easier way to filter and access data that is spread over multiple partitions.</p>
<p><strong>MQTT</strong></p>
<p>AWS IoT Core Device Advisor support for MQTT over WebSocket in now generally available. AWS IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed test capability that validates AWS IoT device software for reliable and secure connectivity with AWS IoT Core. With this update, customers can run all three test suites of AWS IoT Core Device Advisor - qualification, custom, and long duration tests - using Signature Version 4 for MQTT over WebSocket. Signature Version 4 is a protocol for authenticating inbound API requests to AWS services, in all AWS Regions.  In addition, all existing connectivity and security test cases within AWS IoT Device Advisor now support MQTT3.1.1 and MQTT5 over WebSocket, making it easier for customers to validate MQTT functionality during device software development before on-boarding them to AWS IoT Core.</p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>AWS License Manager announced a new feature to upgrade EC2 instances with Ubuntu LTS (Long Term Support) operating system to Ubuntu Pro. With Ubuntu Pro subscription, customers get five years of Expanded Security Maintenance (ESM) on the Ubuntu LTS releases from Canonical. Using this License Manager feature, customers can upgrade their Ubuntu LTS instances in-place to Ubuntu Pro without needing to migrate to a new Ubuntu Pro Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For the use of upgraded EC2 instances with Ubuntu Pro, you will be charged on a per-second basis at the applicable On-Demand or Savings Plan rates for Ubuntu Pro. In addition to five more years of security maintenance, Ubuntu Pro provides features such as security coverage for approximately 23000+ packages in Ubuntu Universe repository and live kernel patching. For example, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS will reach end of standard support on May 31, 2023. You can upgrade the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS instances to Ubuntu Pro 18.04 LTS in License Manager to receive security updates until April 2028. To learn more about Ubuntu Pro on EC2, please see this announcement.</p>
<p><strong>AWS CDK</strong></p>
<p>Application Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager that helps DevOps engineers investigate and remediate issues in the context of their applications, now supports AWS CDK applications. Customers who use CDK to model their cloud infrastructure can view their CDK constructs grouped as applications in the Application Manager console.  Application Manager enables customers to monitor the operational status, metrics, and compliance of their applications from a central console through integration with Amazon CloudWatch and AWS Config. The new feature extends this experience to AWS CDK customers. CDK customers can now visualise their application, view application structure including the underlying resources, view alerts, investigate and remediate operational issues, and track costs using Application Manager.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong></p>
<p>Last week the general availability of Apache Kafka receiver and exporter in AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) was announced. ADOT is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. With this release, customers can use the ADOT collector to collect metrics and traces from Kafka and send metrics and traces to Kafka. The release includes support for Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK). Customers can now support new use cases such as large-scale ingestion of historical data via Kafka used as a buffer (to handle backpressure) into Amazon S3, where customers can perform analytics using AWS Glue and AWS Lambda. Furthermore, customers can use the Apache Kafka support in the ADOT collector in Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) monitoring. For example, customers can buffer raw signals (metrics and traces) in Kafka for use cases such as intrusion detection and compliance enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>AWS SAM</strong></p>
<p>The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) Command Line Interface (CLI) announced the launch of local testing support for Amazon API Gateway Lambda authorisers making it easier for developers to locally test their applications containing API Gateway. The AWS SAM CLI is a developer tool that makes it easier to build, test, package, and deploy serverless applications. Customers can now use the SAM CLI to locally emulate API Gateway Lambda authorisers on their machine using the sam local start-api command. Previously, customers had to use AWS Console or AWS CLI to test their API Gateway Lambda authorisers. With this launch, SAM CLI users can speed up their iteration cycles by testing their authoriser code locally. sam local start-api command supports testing of both Lambda authorisers, and Lambda V2 authorisers. This feature is available with SAM CLI version 1.80.0+.</p>
