    <h2 id="december-11th-2023---instalment-182">December 11th, 2023 - Instalment #182</h2>
<p>Welcome to #182 of the AWS open source newsletter, the place for all your AWS and open source needs. This is a special re:Invent packed edition of this newsletter, attempting to catch up and cover all the main talking points, sessions, and announcements. Whilst there is a lot of content to go through, I know that many of you will still be wanting to know about new projects you can try out, and the good news is that we have plenty.</p>
<p>We have some really great new projects for you to try out over the festive period. We have tools to help you assess and analyse your serverless components in use, a new SDK for NodeJS developers, a tool that simplifies providing access to Kubernetes resources, a database scheme validation project, a new Kubernetes csi for Amazon S3, as well as sample projects that include a really cool reference solution for regional data residency, the serverlessvideo project (you might have seen this during re:Invent), and a couple of demo repositories that are using generative AI (I particularly like the travel itinerary generator project).</p>
<p>From projects to prose, as always, we feature a diverse range of open source technologies in this edition. Projects covered include Redis, Go, MLFlow, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, dbt, OpenRewrite, Amazon Corretto, Amazon EMR, lakeFS, Apache Kafka, Memecached, Grafana, GraphQL, Code-OSS, Rust, Kotlin, FreeRTOS, Prometheus, Kubernetes, Amazon EKS, OpenZFS, OpenSearch, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, AWS CDK, Powertools for Lambda, Jupyter, and cdk8s.</p>
<p>This is the last issue of 2023, but don&rsquo;t panic, we will be back in January 2024 for more open source goodness. Before I leave you, I just wanted to say a big thank you to all you readers for coming back week after week. I really appreciate it, and it keeps me going. Until the next issue, enjoy the holiday season,  rest and recharge and will see you all very soon.</p>

<p><strong>multi-database-schema-validator</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3hg">multi-database-schema-validator</a> is a Python based too to help you with database migration. Schema validation plays a vital role during migration, and this Python based validation tool helps in finding the gaps between source and target database objects like Tables, Views, Indexes, Keys, Stored procedures, Functions, Triggers and Sequences with encrypted connection. It generates an output summary and a detailed report in formats such as Microsoft Excel (xlsx) and html. The report explains the object level match percentage (%) per database, per schema and list of missing objects at target referring to the source.</p>
<p>The blog post,  <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3hf">Automate the schema validation process for multiple databases like SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL databases using Python</a> explains how to validate the database objects post-migration for multiple databases like SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and MySQL databases using the [hands on]</p>

<p><strong>multi-region-data-residency</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3hu">multi-region-data-residency</a> This repository demonstrates how to deploy a multi-region architecture with data residency for sensitive data, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Personal Health Information (PHI) data. To maintain data residency for each region, the architecture operates under a silo model with its own isolated infrastructure stack per region. The architecture is suitable for businesses in specific verticals such as Health-care / Life-sciences (HCLS) and FinTech, with business requirements to isolate customer PII/PHI data to a specific region, expanding globally from a single-region architecture, and/or operating in strict regulatory or compliance environments.</p>

<p><strong>serverless-video</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3hv">serverless-video</a> if you were at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ServerlessVideo?src=hashtag_click">re:Invent</a> you might have seen (or even recorded) a video using this project. This new demo is an event-driven video streaming application called serverlessVideo. serverlessVideo is a best practices example of a cost-effective serverless video streaming application built on a microservices architecture.  serverlessVideo enables AWS users to broadcast live video content directly from their cell phones. At the same time, viewers can access live streams and watch on-demand videos. Additionally, serverlessVideo encourages serverless developers to extend the application&rsquo;s functionality by creating custom plugins that hook into the application&rsquo;s event driven architecure.</p>
<p>Check out the README for a very detailed description of the architecture and a break down of the microservices involved in delivering this demo. Very nice indeed.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3hy">personalized-travel-itinerary-planner</a> as we head into the holiday season, what perfect demo to try out than a tool that uses generative AI to provide personalised travel recommendations. This solution contains two major components. At first, we will extract the user’s information like Name, location, hobbies, interests and Favourite food etc along with their upcoming travel booking details. With this information we will stitch a user prompt together and pass it to Amazon Bedrock/Anthropic Claude LLM to obtain a personalized travel itinerary that the Customers can use. Below architecture diagram provides us a high level overview of the workflow and the components involved in this architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Advanced JDBC Wrapper Driver</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38q">Amazon Web Services JDBC Driver</a> is an open sourced, advanced JDBC wrapper. This wrapper is complementary to and extends the functionality of an existing JDBC driver to help an application take advantage of the features of clustered databases such as Amazon Aurora. We featured this project in <a href="https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-174-3304">#174</a> but if you want to know more about this driver, then Dave Cramer has put together essential reading in his post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3h9">Achieve one second or less downtime with the Advanced JDBC Wrapper Driver when upgrading Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB Clusters</a> as he explores how to use the driver to handle the failover of an Amazon Aurora cluster. [hands on]</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>We had plenty of great content for PostgreSQL fans over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>To start we have Jeff Li and Shunan Xiang who show you four architectures to store business objects with array data fields to a PostgreSQL database in the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3hb">Architectures for managing array data in PostgreSQL</a>. They explore table design, its effects on applications and data migration jobs, and also show how to search and filter database records based on array values and what options are available to improve operation performance.</p>
<p>If you are looking for options and ideas to minimise downtime for your PostgreSQL upgrades, then check out <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3hc">Fast switchovers with PgBouncer on Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments with two readable standbys for PostgreSQL</a> from Yuli Khodorkovskiy and Rajat Jain. They demonstrate how you can typically achieve less than one second of write downtime during a minor version upgrade on an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ cluster for PostgreSQL using the patches for PgBouncer from AWS. [hands on]</p>
<p>The last post in this round up is from Rohan Bhatia, Eric Felice, and Rinisha Marar who have put together <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3ha">Using write forwarding with Amazon Aurora Global Database for PostgreSQL</a>. In this post they show you how to enable and use the write forwarding feature within an Aurora Global Database for PostgreSQL to provide benefits for your application in terms of scalability, geographic load balancing, disaster recovery, and cost optimization. Read the post to understand more about write forwarding and where you might find it beneficial.</p>

<p><strong>Code-OSS</strong></p>
<p>During re:Invent, a new integrated development environment (IDE) option was launched in Amazon SageMaker Studio: Code Editor. It is based on Code-OSS (Visual Studio Code – Open Source). To find out more, Eric Peña, Bruno Pistone, Giuseppe Angelo Porcelli, Sofian Hamiti, and Vikesh Pandey have put together <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3hp">New – Code Editor, based on Code-OSS VS Code Open Source now available in Amazon SageMaker Studio</a>, that helps you get started.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2023/11/30/TarmacBlogArchitectureFinal.png" alt="overview of code editor architecture"></p>
<p><strong>Rust</strong></p>
<p>Zelda Hessler announced the general availability of the AWS SDK for Rust in the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3h5">Announcing general availability of the AWS SDK for Rust</a>. Check it out to find out how to get started, how to contribute to the SDK development, and what is on the public roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>Kotlin</strong></p>
<p>We had good news for Kotlin developers too, with the announcement of the general availability of the AWS SDK for Kotlin. Aaron Todd shares more details in the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3h6">Announcing general availability of the AWS SDK for Kotlin</a> and covers some of the high level features as well as sharing links to the roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>FreeRTOS</strong></p>
<p>FreeRTOS is an open-source, cloud-neutral real-time operating system for microcontrollers and microprocessors that offers a fast, dependable, and responsive kernel, making it easy for you to design and develop cloud-connected IoT devices. An update that some of you might have missed is that the FreeRTOS roadmap is now published on freertos.org and GitHub. With this update, you can transparently access information on specific FreeRTOS features and have a consolidated view of upcoming, ongoing, and shipped FreeRTOS projects to plan your projects accordingly. In addition, you can track the status of your requested FreeRTOS features or the projects you have volunteered to work on.</p>
<p>FreeRTOS announced the availability last week of modular and composable Over-The-Air update (OTA) libraries that make it easy for you to configure and customize the system update process for your Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Using FreeRTOS OTA libraries, you can quickly build connected products capable of seamlessly processing remote firmware update tasks, thus allowing you to manage and maintain your device fleet to be up to date. With the new update, you can now configure FreeRTOS open source OTA libraries in small batches for better flexibility as compared to using a large library that may require base-code modification. For example, to retain operational integrity and continuity of your deployed IoT devices, you can now configure your modular FreeRTOS libraries to first require the device to be in a ‘safe’ or ‘commissioning’ mode and only then accept and process software update messages.</p>
<p><strong>Prometheus</strong></p>
<p>Announced last week was the Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus collector, a fully-managed agentless collector customers can use to collect Prometheus metrics from their workloads running on Amazon EKS. Customers can now enable the discovery and collection of Prometheus metrics from their Amazon EKS applications and infrastructure through the EKS console or through an API call, without having to self-manage agents.</p>
<p>Customers currently invest days, if not weeks, of effort to monitor, right-size, and operate Prometheus agents. Now with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus collector, customers can automatically discover and collect Prometheus metrics from their Amazon EKS applications, infrastructure, and the Kubernetes apiserver without having to install any agents in their cluster. The fully-managed collector removes the “undifferentiated heavy lifting” of installing, patching, scaling, and upgrading agents for the discovery and collection of Prometheus metrics. The collector provides customers with a multi-AZ, highly available, reliable, and fully-managed service for collecting Prometheus metrics without any data ever leaving secure VPCs.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes</strong></p>
<p>If you have spent any time working with Kubernetes on AWS, you will be familiar with having to work with IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA). To make developers lives easier, Amazon EKS introduced EKS Pod Identity last week, which is a new feature that simplifies how cluster administrators can configure Kubernetes applications to obtain AWS IAM permissions. These permissions can now be easily configured with fewer steps directly through EKS console, APIs, and CLI. EKS Pod Identity makes it easy to use an IAM role across multiple clusters and simplifies policy management by enabling the reuse of permission policies across IAM roles.</p>
<p>EKS Pod Identity offers cluster administrators a simplified workflow for authenticating applications to all AWS resources such as Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and more. As a result, cluster administrators need not switch between the EKS and IAM services, or execute privileged IAM operations to configure permissions required by your applications. IAM roles can now be used across multiple clusters without the need to update the role trust policy when creating new clusters. IAM credentials supplied by EKS Pod Identity include support for role session tags, with support for attributes such as cluster name, namespace, service account name. Role session tags enable administrators to author a single permission policy that can work across roles by allowing access to AWS resources based on matching tags.</p>
<p>My colleague Donnie Prakoso put together a nice post to walk you through it. Check it out, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3h3">Amazon EKS Pod Identity simplifies IAM permissions for applications on Amazon EKS clusters</a>.</p>

<p><strong>OpenZFS</strong></p>
<p>AWS announced on-demand data replication for Amazon FSx for OpenZFS, enabling you to easily and efficiently transfer incremental point-in-time snapshots of your volumes between file systems. On-demand data replication provides a simple and resilient way to replicate production data in a separate file system for development, experimentation, and analytics workloads.</p>
<p>Amazon FSx for OpenZFS provides fully managed, cost-effective, shared file storage powered by the popular OpenZFS file system, with rich OpenZFS-powered data management capabilities like snapshots, data cloning, and compression, as well as sub-millisecond latencies and up to 10 GB/s of throughput. Previously, you could use snapshots to replicate volumes within a file system, making it quick and easy to test new changes to your data and applications. Now, you can also replicate volumes across file systems, enabling full isolation of production and development workloads, so developers or analysts can work with production data without impacting the production environment.</p>
<p>You can replicate volumes across file systems in the same account and region in all regions where FSx for OpenZFS is available. There is no charge for on-demand data replication, but you will pay standard AWS data transfer charges when you replicate across availability zones from or to a Single-AZ file system.</p>
<p>Read <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3h4">Announcing on-demand data replication for Amazon FSx for OpenZFS</a> to dive deeper into this new capability.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong></p>
<p>OpenSearch Service 2.11 now comes with OpenSearch Neural Sparse Retrieval. Search practitioners now have an additional search method to use for their search applications with improved semantic understanding, while keeping computational cost and computational latency low, more in line with lexical search.</p>
<p>Neural Sparse Retrieval is a new kind of sparse embedding method, similar in many ways to classic term-based indexing, but with a better understanding of low-frequency words and phrases. Neural Sparse Retrieval uses transformer-based models (e.g. GPT or BERT) to build information-rich embeddings which solve for the lexical challenge with vocabulary mismatch in a scalable way. This new sparse retrieval functionality with OpenSearch Service offers document-only mode and bi-encoder mode, each with different advantages. Document-only mode can deliver low-latency performance more comparable to lexical search, with limitations for advanced syntax as compared to dense methods. Bi-encoder mode maximizes search relevance while performing at higher latency. With this update, users can now choose the method that works best for their performance, accuracy, and cost requirements.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry</strong></p>
<p>In case you missed it, just before re:Invent, we announced the general availability of logs in the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT). ADOT is a secure, production-ready, AWS supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project. With this launch, customers can use the ADOT collector and supported OpenTelemetry SDKs (for Java, JavaScript, .NET, and Python) to collect and send logs to Amazon CloudWatch and backends supporting OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) such as Amazon OpenSearch (AOS).</p>
<p>Customers can now use ADOT to collect all telemetry data from their containerized AWS workloads running in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) in a standardized manner. By adding support for the Filelog receiver and the AWS CloudWatch Logs exporter to the ADOT collector, you now have a reliable way to collect application logs and ingest them into observability backends. AWS delivers security patches and provides support for logging use cases with this launch. For example, by configuring the ADOT collector in an EKS cluster, using the EKS add-on, you can collect logs from a variety of sources including Syslog and Log4j. At the same time, you can get out-of-the-box metadata enrichment based on OpenTelemetry’s semantic conventions, which enables you to improve correlation of the logs with metrics and traces.</p>
