<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Please please please take 1 minute to <a href="https://pulse.buildon.aws/survey/PJRTOUMK">complete this short survey</a> and bask in the warmth of having helped improve how we support open source.</p>
<h3 id="celebrating-open-source-contributors">Celebrating open source contributors</h3>
<p>The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created.</p>
<p>So thank you to the following open source heroes: Daniel Schroeder, Efe Karakus, Maish Saidel-Keesing,  David Tippet, Varun Jain, Satya, Kevin Mun, Yan Cui, Sean McGrail, Vinay Kumar Khambhampati, Amol Guldagad, Sandeep Singh, Cristobal Espinosa, Matt Cline, Sai Kiran Akula, and Samiullah Mohammed</p>
<p><strong>.NET on AWS</strong></p>
<p>It was great to see <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pq">this tweet</a> around our continued support for open source projects that help .NET developers on AWS. This month we supported the <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pr">Marten</a> project. The Marten library provides .NET developers with the ability to use the proven PostgreSQL database engine and its fantastic JSON support as a fully fledged document database. Very cool. Make sure you follow <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2qz">@dotnetonAWS</a> to keep up on other projects we are sponsoring.</p>
<p>Also hot off the press is news that the .NET open-source team announced the release of Core WCF v1.4.0-preview with Queue Transport support and RabbitMQ implementation. RabbitMQ implementation also allows developers to use Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ for dispatching and processing messages out of the box. Core WCF is an open-sourced project where we collaborate with Microsoft actively as partners. Specific AWS contributions of note include the end-to-end design of Queue Transport layer that enables multiple queue providers to be built on top of the existing transport layer; and additional Core WCF packages: CoreWCF.RabbitMQ and CoreWCF.RabbitMQ.Client that enable customers to use AmazonMQ for RabbitMQ from Core WCF and opens up a pathway for customers to use different messaging technologies on AWS and not be tied to just MSMQ on-premises.</p>
<h3 id="latest-open-source-projects">Latest open source projects</h3>
<p><em>The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.</em></p>

<h3 id="aws-and-community-blog-posts">AWS and Community blog posts</h3>
<p><strong>Community roundup</strong></p>
<p>We had a great selection of community authored content that caught my eye this week.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-144-22h">#144</a> we featured <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2hs">dynamodb-shell</a>, a simple CLI for DynamoDB modeled on isql, and the MySQL CLIs. Satya has put together a short post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2qc">AWS DynamoDB Shell - ddbsh</a>, where he walks through some examples of using this.</p>
<p>Next up we have Kevin Mun with his post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2qf">I bring up my full-stack AWS application in ten minutes, here are the open-source tools you will be using</a> shares his experience (and delight!) in using one open source tool, sst, to help make his life easier and more productive.</p>
<p>From sst to AWS CDK, this time AWS Hero Yan Cui with his take on the strengths and weaknesses of AWS CDK based on his own use cases and experience. Worth reading anything from Yan as you know he has put a lot of thought into it.</p>
<p>The final post in this round up comes from the folk behind <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2n1">ZeusCloud</a>,  an open source tool to help you discover, prioritise, and remediate your risks in the cloud that we featured in <a href="https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-150-352g">#150</a>. In <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2qg">AWS Account ID: An Attacker&rsquo;s Perspective</a>, Varun Jain shares details about how exposing your AWS Account number is useful to potential attackers. I certainly learned a few things from reading this post.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Libcrypto for Rust</strong></p>
<p>AWS Libcrypto for Rust (aws-lc-rs) is a new open source cryptographic library for Rust software developers with FIPS cryptographic requirements. In the blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pz">Introducing AWS Libcrypto for Rust, an Open Source Cryptographic Library for Rust</a>, Sean McGrail provides a hands on introduction to this library and shows you how you can get started. [hands on]</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2023/04/14/libcrypto-rust-chart.png" alt="graph of aws-ls-rs benchmarks"></p>
<p><strong>Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>One of my favorite open source related announcements at re:Invent 2022 was Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL, an open source development kit that lets developers create extensions in their preferred language with built-in safety guardrails. In this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2qb">Supabase Makes Extensions Easier for Developers with Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL</a> we take a look at how Supabase are using Trusted Language Extensions for PostgreSQL to make the Supabase platform easier to deploy across multiple cloud providers and to make it easier for developers to add extensions in Supabase. Essential reading this week!</p>
<p><strong>Apache Airflow</strong></p>
<p>I put together a couple of blog posts last week on Apache Airflow. The first was borne out of wanting to know more about the recently launched (and hotly anticipated) feature that allows you to now specify a startup script that will launch at the start of your worker nodes. In <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2po">Exploring Shell Launch Scripts on Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) and mwaa-local-runner</a> I show you how you can use mwaa-local-runner to test this before you deploy to your Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA), including how to patch a current issue I found that stopped the environment variables working within mwaa-local-runner.</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1VgtDTZI--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_800/https://ricsuepublicresources.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/airflow-variables.png" alt="workflow diagram of how startup scripts outline"></p>
<p>As I was writing this, I was speaking to some developers who were looking to experiment with mwaa-local-runner but wanted to do this in their AWS Cloud9 developer environments. I put this recipe together, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pp">Getting mwaa-local-runner up on AWS Cloud9</a>. I would welcome feedback on how to improve the setup and make it even easier to deploy mwaa-local-runner on Cloud9.</p>
<p>The final Apache Airflow update (this time, not written by me!), is an update to the MWAA migration documentation,  <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2px">Migrating workloads from AWS Data Pipeline to Amazon MWAA</a>, where you can check this new section that has been added to help those who are using AWS Data Pipeline service migrate those pipelines to Apache Airflow.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Oozie</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2q4">Apache Oozie</a> is an open source workflow scheduler system to manage Apache Hadoop jobs. In the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2q5">Accelerate HiveQL with Oozie to Spark SQL migration on Amazon EMR</a>, Vinay Kumar Khambhampati, Amol Guldagad, and Sandeep Singh walk you through a solution that automates the migration from HiveQL to Spark SQL with Oozie workloads, and is battle tested in a real world use case. [hands on]</p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon Corretto</strong></p>
<p>On April 18, 2023 Amazon announced quarterly security and critical updates for Amazon Corretto Long-Term Supported (LTS) versions of OpenJDK. Corretto 20.0.1, 17.0.7, 11.0.19, 8u372 are now available for download. Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. With this release, we are declaring aarch64 Alpine Linux binaries of Corretto 17, 11, and 8 GA.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Amplify</strong></p>
<p>AWS Amplify announced support for Push Notifications for Swift, Android, Flutter, and React Native applications. This means that developers can now use Amplify to set up push notifications when targeting iOS and Android platforms, providing developers and businesses with a way to engage with users and send them timely and relevant information. Developers can now set up campaigns to segment and target specific users. Personalising push notifications with AWS Amplify allows mobile and cross-platform developers to target specific users with important updates, promotions, and new features, resulting in higher engagement and increased user satisfaction.</p>
<p>Read the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2q6">AWS Amplify supports Push Notifications for Android, Swift, React Native, and Flutter apps</a>, that shows you how to add push notifications features to your Android applications with AWS Amplify, and then send targeted messages to your users.</p>
<p><strong>Flutter</strong></p>
<p>The AWS Amplify Flutter team unveiled the version 1.0.0 last week, which will help app development by adding support for both web and desktop platforms. You can now with a single codebase target 6 platforms, including iOS, Android, Web, Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Dive deeper into the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2qx">Amplify Flutter announces general availability for web and desktop support</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/0a57cb53ba59c46fc4b692527a38a87c78d84028/2023/04/14/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif" alt="demo screenshot of amplify flutter 1.0"></p>
<p><strong>Apache Hive Metastore</strong></p>
<p>AWS Lake Formation and the Glue Data Catalog now extend data cataloging, data sharing and fine-grained access control support for customers using a self-managed Apache Hive Metastore (HMS) as their data catalog. Previously, customers had to replicate their metadata into the AWS Glue Data Catalog in order use Lake Formation permissions and data sharing capabilities. Now, customers can integrate their HMS metadata within AWS, allowing them to discover data alongside native tables in the Glue data catalog, manage permissions and sharing from Lake Formation, and query data using AWS analytics services.</p>
<p>To get started, customers using this feature will need to connect their HMS databases and tables as federation objects into their AWS Glue Data Catalog (check out <a href="https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-152-2eo4">#153</a>, and the <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2oq">aws-glue-data-catalog-federation</a> project). Customers can then grant Lake Formation column, tag, and data filter permissions on tables as if they were native AWS Glue Data Catalog tables. These permissions are then applied whenever those tables are queried by Lake Formation supported AWS services, simplifying the management of unified data access controls. Finally, customers can audit access and permissions on their HMS resources using AWS CloudTrail logs generated on all data and metadata access events.</p>
<p><strong>Python</strong></p>
<p>AWS Lambda now supports Python 3.10 as both a managed runtime and a container base image. To deploy Lambda functions using Python 3.10, upload the code through the Lambda console and select the Python 3.10 runtime. You can also use the AWS CLI, AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) and AWS CloudFormation to deploy and manage serverless applications written in Python 3.10. Additionally, you can also use the AWS-provided Python 3.10 base image to build and deploy Python 3.10 functions using a container image. AWS will automatically apply updates to the Python 3.10 managed runtime and to the AWS-provided Python 3.10 base image, as they become available.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong></p>
<p>Amazon EMR on EC2 now provides contextual error details that makes it easier to troubleshoot cluster provisioning failures. EMR lets you provision your EMR on EC2 cluster without worrying about managing compute infrastructure or open-source application setup. However, there can be circumstances when your cluster provisioning fails, such as an insufficient EC2 instance capacity error, bootstrap action failure or a VPC-subnet misconfiguration error. With today’s launch, you will now find additional error details in the new EMR console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and the AWS SDK. These additional error details are automatically enabled for all EMR versions and no further action is needed.</p>
<p>Previously when users encountered a provisioning error, such as a bootstrap failure, they would receive an error message that the cluster failed but with no further context. Identifying whether the root cause was an invalid or conflicting bootstrap action or a misconfigured bootstrap source file location took multiple steps. With today’s launch, you will get specific error details for cluster provisioning failures along with detailed root cause, and recommendations to resolve the failure. You can find these details in the Cluster list view in the new console and via APIs.</p>
<p><strong>LoRaWAN</strong></p>
<p>AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN announces public network support (preview) for LoRaWAN-based Internet of Things (IoT) systems. With this update, customers can now easily connect their IoT devices to the cloud using publicly available LoRaWAN networks provided by Everynet, a global LoRaWAN network operator offering carrier grade networks. Using AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN, customers can simply register their devices to the cloud and opt for public network support in the AWS IoT console. Within minutes, they will be able to receive data from registered LoRaWAN devices in their AWS account.</p>
<p>AWS IoT Core for LoRaWAN is a fully managed LoRaWAN Network Server (LNS) that enables customers to connect their LoRaWAN-enabled wireless devices, typically used for low-power, long-range wide area network connectivity, to AWS. IoT system operators now do not need to deploy and maintain their own private LoRaWAN network, resulting in development, management, and operational cost savings. It also streamlines billing processes as system operators do not need to interface with individual network provider for managing network subscription costs.</p>
<p><strong>gMSA</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is announcing availability of ECS-optimised Amazon Linux 2023 (AL2023) AMIs and group managed service accounts (gMSA) on ECS Linux containers through credentials-fetcher integration. gMSA is a managed account that provides automatic password management, service principal name (SPN) management, and the ability to delegate management to administrators over multiple servers or instances. This integration allows applications hosted on Amazon ECS Linux containers to easily authenticate with Microsoft Active Directory (AD) to access network shared resources. This integration enables customers to continue using AD as well as get the cost, reliability, and scalability benefits of Amazon Linux on ECS.</p>
<p>As you deploy your .NET applications, the applications hosted on Linux containers need to connect to network resources such as SQL Server hosts or storage blocks that are authenticated over Microsoft AD. The gMSA credentials-fetcher is now directly integrated into Amazon ECS. You can use credentials-fetcher to access AD from services hosted on Linux containers using the service account authentication model. Developers and system administrators can use the ECS agent for a managed configuration experience on the ECS platform.</p>
<p>To dive deeper into this, check out the excellent post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pt">Using Windows Authentication with gMSA on Linux Containers on Amazon ECS</a>, where Cristobal Espinosa, Matt Cline, Sai Kiran Akula, and Samiullah Mohammed provide a nice detailed  walk through on how to integrate Credentials Fetcher with Amazon ECS.</p>
