<meta name="twitter:description" content="January 18th, 2021 - Instalment #52 Newsletter #52
This week we have a number of posts covering AWS Cloud Development Kit, (AWS CDK) as well as Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) which you should check out (ok, I&rsquo;ll admit I might have been involved in some of those) as well as a couple of interesting projects. Don&rsquo;t miss the summary of re:Invent from last week - still plenty of time to catch up with the on demand videos."/>

    <h1>AWS open source news and updates #52</h1>
    <h2 id="january-18th-2021---instalment-52">January 18th, 2021 - Instalment #52</h2>
<p>Newsletter #52</p>
<p>This week we have a number of posts covering AWS Cloud Development Kit, (AWS CDK) as well as Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) which you should check out (ok, I&rsquo;ll admit I might have been involved in some of those) as well as a couple of interesting projects. Don&rsquo;t miss the summary of re:Invent from last week - still plenty of time to catch up with the on demand videos. I cover both the open source track and the sessions from other tracks that feature open source projects. But before you dive into the newsletter, a couple of short notices including a very nice open source newsletter that is a must sign up to&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Apache Software Foundation</strong></p>
<p>If you have not seen/read the Apache Software Foundation blog, then well worth signing up to <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1j">The Apache Software Foundation Blog</a> to catch up with all the latest news and updates from many of the projects you are likely to be using. Aside from that they also share some great insights into open source, community and the overall impact of open source in society. Great stuff, and this weeks must read.</p>
<p><strong>Console</strong></p>
<p>Fellow Amazonian Jackson Kelley has a brilliant open source newsletter that is absolutely essential you sign up to. Aside from covering great open source projects, each week he talks to open source builders and asks them some great questions. These are the hook that will keep you coming back. Awesome work Jackson!</p>
<p>Take a <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27">look and sign up here.</a></p>
<p><strong>Python 2.7 end of support</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you check this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2a">Announcing the end of support for Python 2.7 in the AWS SDK for Python and AWS CLI v1</a> if you are using v1 of the AWS Cli and Python 2.7. Important details and dates with regards to end of support which you should make sure you understand and plan for.</p>
<h3 id="celebrate-open-source-contributors">Celebrate open source contributors</h3>
<p>The articles posted in this series are only possible thanks to contributors and project maintainers and so I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to build on top of what they have created.</p>
<p>So thank you to the following superstars: Yi Ai, Michael Hausenblas, Gary Stafford, Florian Valery, Denis Gladkikh, Michael Bailey, Andrea Cavagna, the folks at cloudquery, Rene Brandel, Brian Likosar, Larry Heathcote, Amit Gupta, Troy Ameigh, Julia Kroll, Dipankar Ghosal, Janakarajan Natarajan, Prashant Agrawal, Jennifer Bland, Matt Coulter and Elad Ben-Israel.</p>
<p>Make sure you find and follow these builders and keep up to date with their open source projects and contributions.</p>
<h3 id="latest-from-open-source-projects">Latest from open source projects</h3>
<p><strong>coldsnap</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1e">coldsnap</a> coldsnap is an open source command-line interface that uses the Amazon EBS direct APIs to upload and download snapshots. It does not need to launch an EC2 instance or manage EBS volume attachments. It can be used to simplify snapshot handling in an automated pipeline. The tool came to my attention via this blog post from Michael Bailey, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1f">Open Source Tool Release: Gaining Novel AWS Access With EBS Direct APIs</a> where he look at some of the innovative ways that the APIs can be used. To give you a hint, check out this extract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In relation to the work of Crypsis (a Palo Alto Networks company that provides cybersecurity professional services including digital forensics and incident response (DFIR), offensive security and proactive work), EBS direct APIs could be used to interact with AWS in ways not previously seen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They provide links to a repo with some code as well. Definitely a post to check out this week.</p>
<p><strong>formik-core</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1g">formik-core</a> FormKiQ Core is an Open Source Headless Document Management System (DMS) that runs completely AWS and can support any size organisation, from personal websites to large, enterprise organisations requiring full control of any number of internal and external documents. It looks like it is built from serverless components which means you can focus on writing great content and leave the infrastructure to AWS.</p>
<h3 id="blog-posts-from-the-community-and-customers">Blog posts from the community and customers</h3>
<p><strong>PySpark, Apache Spark, Apache Airflow and more</strong></p>
<p>I missed these somehow, but Gary Stafford has put together a couple of great posts that show a number of open source big data tools that you have probably heard of, but maybe not sure what they do or how they fit together. To set the scene, he talks about <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/18">Running PySpark Applications on Amazon EMR</a> and shares how to use PySpark, a python API for Apache Spark, to interact with a number of these open source big data tools.</p>
<p>In his follow up post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/19">Running Spark Jobs on Amazon EMR with Apache Airflow</a> he walks you through how to setup orchestration to automate the steps from the first step, putting a typical use case of how these technologies can work together to produce faster time to value from your data. This is probably the best walkthrough I have seen for the newly launched Managed Workflows for Apache Flow I have seen so far.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-mwaa-complex-workflow-using-step-functions/raw/main/images/architecture.png" alt="arch"></p>
<p>We had another great blog post over the Christmas period that I missed. In <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2e">Automating a Machine Learning Workflow using Google BigQuery and Amazon Managed Apache Airflow</a>, AWS Community Builder Yi Ai shows you how you can orchestrate workflows across different vendors. The walk through helps you build the workflow end to end, and you can modify it to your own ends. I especially liked the workaround to be able to deploy Python packages you might need on your worker nodes. If you are interested in orchestration or Apache Airflow, then check this out.</p>

<p><strong>ECS ComposeX</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2d">Wordpress CMS from docker-compose to AWS in a few steps</a> John Preston shares a blog post to coincide with the latest release of the <a href="https://docs.compose-x.io/changelog.html#id1">ECS-ComposeX tool 0.11</a> showing you how you can simply automate the deployment of one of the most common CMS</p>
<p><strong>Deploying Ghost 3.00</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1a">Deploying Ghost 3.0 to AWS using EC2 Auto Scaling, RDS and Terraform – Pt 1</a> Florian Valery writes a two part post (second part is in the blog post) on how to deploy the Ghost open source blogging software in the Cloud. Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in JavaScript and distributed under the MIT License, designed to simplify the process of online publishing for individual bloggers as well as online publications. Florian provides everything you need including code/scripts in the GitHub repo.</p>

<p><strong>AWS Amplify</strong></p>
<p>A couple of posts this week. First up we have one on getting deeper insights into your traffic. Following that we have one on how to use AWS Amplify to add authentication to a Vue application.</p>
<p>If you love AWS Amplify and you use it to run/host some of your applications but you are now looking for a way to get deeper insights in how your users are interacting with it. What are the most popular pages or are there any issues that you need to fix. Analysing logs is one part of how to address this, and Denis Gladkikh has put together this blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1b">Analyzing AWS Amplify Access logs. Part 1.</a> to walk you through a number of different options. Take a read to find out what the options are and watch out for part 2 when it surfaces by following Denis (and checking out his other blog posts)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.outcoldman.com/en/archive/2021/01/14/analyzing-aws-amplify-access-logs-part-1/numbers.png" alt="solution"></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1v">How to Add Authentication to a Vue App Using AWS Amplify</a> Jennifer Bland shows you how you can create a new Vue application and then using AWS Amplify, add authentication. She provides full source code to this walkthrough.</p>
<p><strong>CloudQuery</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1c">How to run AWS CIS Benchmark with CloudQuery</a> I have introduced readers to this newsletter about this open source project before (<a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1i">check out newsletter 45</a>) and cloudquery is an open source tool that allows you to interact with your cloud infrastructure via queryable SQL or Graphs for easy monitoring, governance and security. In this post, they show you how to run AWS CIS benchmark with CloudQuery using out-of-the-box SQL statements that you can customised to your environment. Watch out for future posts too.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Single Sign On</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1d">AWS Single Sign-on for DevOps: is CLI v2 the best option?</a> Andrea Cavagna has put together a post that talks about the various options you have today when it comes to AWS single sign on (AWS SSO). He shares insights of the strengths and weakness before sharing an updat eabout a project I have talked about previously, Leaap, and how this now integrates with AWS Single Sign on so that you can simplify your life and make it easier and safer to connect to your AWS resources. Check out the source code here -  <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1h">https://github.com/Noovolari/leapp</a></p>

<p><strong>AWS Open Distro for OpenTelemetry</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2c">Migrating X-Ray tracing to AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry</a> open source builder Michael Hausenblas shows you how you can send traces from an AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) enabled application to X-Ray, to help kick start you if you are looking to migrate your applications traces (and logs and metrics in the future too). Michael uses an example Amazon EKS to show you how you would migrate a typical distributed tracing setup.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2021/01/14/adot-tracing-setup-1024x852.png" alt="arch"></p>
<p>(Thanks Michael for spotting the typo!)</p>
<p><strong>AWS CDK</strong></p>
<p>This week we have a few stories covering the AWS Cloud Development Kit, or AWS CDK.</p>
<p>Kicking off with Richard H Boyd&rsquo;s post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1w">CDK Corner – January 2021</a> sharing some updates about the AWS CDK roadmap if you missed the sessions during re:Invent. Richard talks about AWS CDKv2, what was learnt and what common issues it is looking to address. Essential reading.</p>
<p>Following that why not educate yourself in the backstory of AWS CDK. In this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1x">Working backwards: The story behind the AWS Cloud Development Kit</a>, I talked with Elad Ben-Israel to understand how AWS CDK came about, how the team set themselves up for success and the importance of open source projects addressing real problems.</p>
<p>Finally we have Matt Coulter (Technical Architect at Liberty Mutual), whose post <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1y">The CDK Patterns open source journey</a>, takes a look at the journey and path of CDK Patterns, an open source repository that shares re-usable patterns to solve real developer use cases. More than that though, the post talks about how these are aligned to things like the Well Architected Framework to provide more confidence when using these assets. Matts post highlights some of the reasons why this project has been so impactful and garnered so much interest and contributions, with some great data points. If you have not heard or reviewed the site, check it out today - full links provided in the post.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Amplify</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1n">NEW in Amplify DataStore: Selective sync and sort functionality</a> this post from Rene Brandel shares new features that have been incorporated into <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1o">Amplify DataStore</a>. From the blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amplify DataStore (JavaScript, Android, and iOS) provides frontend web and and mobile developers a persistent on-device storage repository for you to write, read, and observe changes to data even if you are online or offline, and seamlessly sync to the cloud as well as across devices. With the recent Amplify Library release, DataStore gains the ability to selectively sync a subset of your app data and to sort your app data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Apache Airflow</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1s">Building complex workflows with Amazon MWAA, AWS Step Functions, AWS Glue, and Amazon EMR</a> Dipankar Ghosal has put together a post to show how you can build complex workflows in Apache Airflow, or more specifically the recently launched Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow. This post demonstrates how to use Amazon MWAA as a primary workflow management service to create and run complex workflows and extend the directed acyclic graph (DAG) to start and monitor a state machine created using Step Functions. If you are just getting started with this service then this is a must read. I have spent quite a bit of time over the last week getting introduced to this service, and I was glad for some of the insights that Dipankar shares.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/01/05/BDB1205-6.jpg" alt="workflow"></p>
<p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong></p>
<p>Data streaming technologies like Apache Kafka serve as a highly available transport layer that decouples the data-producing applications from data processors. One problem that arises however, is that due to the number of applications producing, processing, routing, and consuming data, it can become difficult to coordinate and evolve data schemas, like adding or removing a data field, without introducing data quality issues and downstream application failures. In this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1p">Validate, evolve, and control schemas in Amazon MSK and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with AWS Glue Schema Registry</a> Brian Likosar and Larry Heathcote provide some answers as to how you can use schema registries to solve this problem.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2021/01/13/msk-kds-glue-schema-registry-1.jpg" alt="schema resolution"></p>
<p><strong>PyPi</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1r">Hosting a private PyPI server for Amazon SageMaker Studio notebooks in a VPC</a> Julia Kroll shares how you can setup a private PyPi repository (Python Package Index), running on an Amazon EC2 instance. PyPi repos are used when using standard tools such as pip, and it makes it easy to find and install hundreds of thousands of packages, including common packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Pytest, Requests, Django, and BeautifulSoup. If you are looking for more control on how your developers or build environments install python packages, then this post is for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2020/12/17/ML-1349-1.jpg" alt="arch"></p>
<p><strong>zlib</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1t">Improving zlib-cloudflare and comparing performance with other zlib forks</a> Janakarajan Natarajan shares some of the work we have been doing to help improve and optimise the performance of this library. The zlib compression library is widely used to compress and decompress data. This library is utilized by popular programs like the Java Development Kit (JDK), Linux distributions, libpng, Git, and many others. In thie post Janakarajan describes the work done in zlib-cloudflare to improve its decompression performance and he takes a look at how this compares with other zlib forks on both compression and decompression operations, using the Silesia Corpus (a collection of modern-day workloads) and a custom benchmark tool.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2020/12/21/janakan_zlib-cloudflare_f1.png" alt="benchmark graph"></p>
<p><strong>Elasticsearch</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1u">Masking field values with Amazon Elasticsearch Service</a> Prashant Agrawal takes you through how to set up field masking within your Amazon ES domain. Field masking is an alternative to field-level security that lets you anonymise the data in a field rather than remove it altogether. This is helpful where you have use cases where users reviewing those insights should not have access to all the details from the log data.</p>
<h3 id="aws-partners">AWS Partners</h3>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>Apache Ranger</strong></p>
<p>Amazon EMR now natively integrates with Apache Ranger, allowing you to define, enforce, and audit fine-grained data access control. With this feature, you can define and enforce 1/ database, table, and column level authorisation policies for Apache Spark and Apache Hive users to access data through Hive Metastore, and 2/ prefix and object level authorisation policies when accessing data in Amazon S3 via the Amazon EMR File System (EMRFS), leveraging Amazon CloudWatch to capture auditing logs.</p>
<p>Apache Ranger is an open-source tool to enable, monitor, and manage comprehensive data security across the Hadoop platform. Previously, you can use Apache Ranger to enforce fine-grained authorisation on data in HDFS with Apache Hive using <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1l">this blog post</a>. Now this native integration enables additional capabilities. You can define three types of authorisation policies on Apache Ranger Policy Admin server. You can set table, column, and row level authorisation for Apache Hive, table and column level authorisation for Apache Spark, and prefix and object level authorisation for Amazon S3. Amazon EMR automatically installs and configures the corresponding Apache Ranger plugins on the cluster. These Ranger plugins sync up with the Policy Admin server for authorisation polices, enforce data access control, and send auditing events to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.</p>

<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Starting today, you can perform an in-place upgrade of your Amazon Aurora database cluster from MySQL major version 5.6 to 5.7. Instead of backing up and restoring the database to the new version, you can upgrade with just a few clicks in the Amazon RDS Management Console or by using the AWS SDK or CLI. Aurora MySQL 5.7 offers enhancements such as JSON support, spatial indexes, and generated columns. Aurora’s native implementation of spatial indexing also can deliver &gt;20x better write performance and &gt;10x better read performance than MySQL 5.7 for spatial datasets.</p>
<p>To upgrade to Aurora MySQL 5.7, select the &ldquo;Modify&rdquo; option on the AWS Management Console corresponding to the database instance you want to upgrade, choose the version of Aurora MySQL 5.7 you want to upgrade to, and proceed with the wizard. The upgrade may be applied immediately (if you select the &ldquo;Apply Immediately&rdquo; option), or during your next maintenance window (by default). Please note that in either case, your database cluster will be unavailable during the upgrade and your database instances will be restarted. Please review the Aurora documentation to learn more.</p>
