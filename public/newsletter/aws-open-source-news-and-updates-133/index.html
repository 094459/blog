<meta name="twitter:description" content="October 28th, 2022 - Instalment #133 Welcome
Welcome to the AWS open source newsletter, edition #133. This week has been all about KubeCon, and there were some important announcements from AWS. If you missed these, I have tried to capture the important ones here, but I want to start off with probably my favourite which was the announcement during Nate Taber keynote on some of the investments we are providing to CNCF and OpenSSF."/>

    <h1>AWS open source news and updates #133</h1>
    <h2 id="october-28th-2022---instalment-133">October 28th, 2022 - Instalment #133</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the AWS open source newsletter, edition #133. This week has been all about KubeCon, and there were some important announcements from AWS. If you missed these, I have tried to capture the important ones here, but I want to start off with probably my favourite which was the announcement during Nate Taber keynote on some of the investments we are providing to CNCF and OpenSSF. AWS is providing $3 million in credits to CNCF, as well as providing $10 million over 3 years to the Open SSF and providing fixes and test suites to open source projects.</p>
<p>This week we feature the following new open source projects, &ldquo;aws-logs-comptroller&rdquo; keep on top of your AWS CloudWatch log groups, &ldquo;cloudcanvas&rdquo; a Mac based app for interacting with some of your AWS resources, &ldquo;atlearn&rdquo; a tool to help you with transfer learning, &ldquo;aws-code-habits&rdquo; bootstrap your dev setup with some good defaults, &ldquo;cargo-check-external-types&rdquo; a tool for Rust developers, &ldquo;OQpy&rdquo;, &ldquo;spin-wasm-multi-compute&rdquo; a science project on wasm, and plenty more.</p>
<p>We also cover open source topics including MySQL, MariaDB, cdk8s, Apache Kafka, Apache CloudStack, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenFold, Composer, Flask, OQpy, Kotlin, AWS CDK, eventcatalog, traefik, Redis, CNCF, OpenSSF, Ploomber, Soopervisor, and more! Before you go, make sure you check out this weeks videos and we have the usual round up of open source events that are coming up.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Please let me know how we can improve this newsletter as well as how AWS can better work with open source projects and technologies by completing <a href="https://eventbox.dev/survey/NUSZ91Z">this very short survey </a>that will take you probably less than 30 seconds to complete. Thank you so much!</p>
<p><strong>Celebrating open source contributors</strong></p>
<p>The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created.</p>
<p>So thank you to the following open source heroes: Sai Vennam, Toshal Dudhwala, Imaya Kumar Jagannathan, Massimo Re Ferrè, Matt Morgan, Shimon Tolts, Philip Reinhold, Li Chen, Jean-Christophe Jaskula, Peter Karalekas, Stephanie Teo, Bandish Shah, Olivier Cruchant, Joseph Keating, Matt Hedges, Steve Roberts, Angel Pizarro, Jason Rupard, Mariana Ramos Franco, Ran Isenberg, Matt Martz, Abhishek Gupta, John Mille, and Elena van Engelen-Maslova.</p>
<h3 id="latest-open-source-projects">Latest open source projects</h3>
<p><em>The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.</em></p>
<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p><strong>aws-logs-comptroller</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/275">aws-logs-comptroller</a> is a neat project from Matt Morgan that I found via Corey&rsquo;s <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/276">newsletter</a> that allows you to keep on top of your AWS CloudWatch log groups. AWS Logs Comptroller is a CDK Construct that can be used to set CloudWatch log retention as well as prune orphaned LogGroups. AWS Logs Comptroller is written entirely using Step Functions and ASL. As I often have to manually do this for the demos I run, this is going to come in super handy.</p>
<p><strong>cloudcanvas</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27d">cloudcanvas</a> is an interesting project to keep your eyes on that provides an interactive canvas to help you manage your cloud resources. It is a downloadable app for your Mac (sorry, Mac only from the looks of it at the moment) that allows you to have a more interactive experience when working with AWS. Currently as this is in early stages, it offers a limited set of AWS services. I have downloaded and installed it, but just need to sort out my test SSO account before I can get stuck in. If I get time, I might show this on the next episode of Build on Open Source.</p>
<p><strong>atlearn</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27e">atlearn</a> is a Transfer Learning toolkit that supports easy model building on top of the pre-trained models. It provides a set of APIs that enable users to load pre-trained models, build and train their customised transfer learning models, and export the models for inference and deployment. Read the documentation to find out more about why this tool was created and some of the benefits, and then check out the demos provided.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/awslabs/atlearn/blob/main/figs/example.png?raw=true" alt="graph of transfer learning for atlearn"></p>
<p><strong>aws-code-habits</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27f">aws-code-habits</a> is a library with Make targets, Ansible playbooks, Jinja templates (and more) designed to boost common software development tasks and enhance governance. If you are looking for a way to automate and bootstrap your new projects, why not check this out.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3298422/198290134-fec4a14d-8542-4b92-9cbc-d33f476e7a74.gif" alt="demo of aws-code-habbits"></p>
<p><strong>cargo-check-external-types</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27g">cargo-check-external-types</a> is a static analysis tool for Rust library authors to set and verify which types from other libraries are allowed to be are exposed in their public API. This is useful for ensuring that a breaking change to a dependency doesn&rsquo;t force a breaking change in the library that&rsquo;s using it.</p>
<p>The tool has two output formats to cover different use-cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>errors (the default): Output error messages for each type that is exposed in the public API and exit with status 1 if there is at least one error. This is useful for continuous integration.</li>
<li>markdown-table: Output the places types are exposed as a Markdown table. This is intended as a discovery tool for established projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you check out the docs for more details on this handy tool, as well as some important prereq&rsquo;s that you need before you can use this too.</p>
<p><strong>OQpy</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/26s">OQpy</a> The goal of oqpy (&ldquo;ock-pie&rdquo;) is to make it easy to generate OpenQASM 3 + OpenPulse in Python. The oqpy library builds off of the openqasm3 and openpulse packages, which serve as Python reference implementations of the abstract syntax tree (AST) for the OpenQASM 3 and OpenPulse grammars. What are OpenQASM 3 and OpenPulse? Well I had the same questions, and thankfully these are answered in the project readme. We also have this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/26t">AWS open-sources OQpy to make it easier to write quantum programs in OpenQASM 3</a> where Philip Reinhold, Li Chen, Jean-Christophe Jaskula, Peter Karalekas, and Stephanie Teo collaborate to share an example of what is possible using OQpy and OpenQASM 3.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/5a5b0f9b7d3f8fc84c3cef8fd8efaaa6c70d75ab/2022/10/20/fig3-3-2.png" alt="graph of OQpy"></p>

<p><strong>spin-wasm-multi-compute</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/277">spin-wasm-multi-compute</a> is a new &ldquo;science project&rdquo; from all round good egg Massimo Re Ferrè where he provides some code samples as he explores the wonderful world of wasm. This demo repo is a rough proof of concept for running the same WASM artefact on Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS/Fargate and AWS Lambda. I also love how Massimo has used another open source project (cdk-dia) to visualise the resulting stack that is deployed via AWS CDK.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/mreferre/spin-wasm-multi-compute/blob/main/images/architecture.png?raw=true" alt="architecture of wasm on aws"></p>
<p><strong>detect-and-handling-custom-pii-with-aws-glue-studio-and-aws-glue-databrew</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/278">detect-and-handling-custom-pii-with-aws-glue-studio-and-aws-glue-databrew</a> aside from winning this weeks open source repo with the longest name, provides an AWS CloudFormation (CFn) template that builds sample data pipeline, with the functionality of identifying personal and sensitive data using the Sensitive Data Detection feature of AWS Glue Studio and apply hashing algorithm to protect columns identified with the use of AWS Glue DataBrew, through an event-driven and serverless architecture.</p>

<p><strong>apprunner-hotel-app</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/279">apprunner-hotel-app</a> this project provisions the base layer infrastructure to demonstrate how AppRunner leverages a VPC Connector to interact with a DB in a private subnet.</p>
<p><strong>aws-dynamodb-parallel-queries</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27a">aws-dynamodb-parallel-queries</a> this repo provides a sample application and queries for you to see how these work and then configure a load generator which you can tune, to see how they perform. Code is in Java.</p>
<p><strong>selective-search-with-mutual-information-cotraining</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27b">selective-search-with-mutual-information-cotraining</a> this repo provide code samples for the research paper, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27c">MICO: Selective Search with Mutual Information Co-training</a>. What is this research paper on? From the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast to traditional exhaustive search, selective search first clusters documents into several groups before all the documents are searched exhaustively by a query, to limit the search executed within one group or only a few groups. Selective search is designed to reduce the latency and computation in modern large-scale search systems.</p>

<p><strong>Kubernetes</strong></p>
<p>As KubeCon NA wraps up, there were a few announcements (covered below in the Quick Updates section) as well as some new blog posts that dive deeper into these.</p>
<p>Steve Roberts took a look at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-batch-for-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service/">AWS Batch for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a> introducing what it is, and how it works.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2022/10/21/batch_for_eks-animation.gif" alt="architecture of aws batch for Amazon EKS"></p>
<p>We also have this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/26w">How AWS Batch developed support for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service
</a> where Angel Pizarro and Jason Rupard look behind the scenes and talk about the initial motivation and design choices when developing the service, as well as some of the challenges that the team overcame.</p>
<p>Whilst not related to KubeCon, Mariana Ramos Franco put together this post, <a href="!%5Bhttps://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/26x%5D(https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/26x)">Speed up Highly Available Deployments on Kubernetes</a>. The Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus provides a Prometheus-compatible monitoring service that is operated on Kubernetes. In the post, she dives deep into the internals of our Prometheus service and how we speed up our deployment times without impacting availability.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2022/10/25/zone-disruption-budget-controller.png" alt="managed prometheus kubernetes architecture"></p>
<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) now supports Apache Kafka version 3.3.1 for new and existing clusters. Apache Kafka 3.3.1 includes several bug fixes and new features that improve performance. Some of the key features include enhancements to metrics and partitioner. Amazon MSK will continue to use and manage Zookeeper for quorum management in this release for stability. For a complete list of improvements and bug fixes, see the Apache Kafka release notes for 3.3.1.</p>
<p><strong>cdk8s</strong></p>
<p>CDK For Kubernetes Plus (CDK8s+) is a multi-language class library for defining Kubernetes applications using high level intent based constructs. We featured a great overview of this in the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1630135246">last episode of Build on Open Source</a> if you want a primer.</p>
<p>CDK8s+ aims to lower the entry barrier and improve maintainability of Kubernetes manifests by offering a hand crafted construct for each core Kubernetes object, exposing a richer API with reduced complexity. With this launch, CDK8s+ is now generally available and stable for use. This means that the API will remain unchanged and fully supported (no breaking changes), at least until the next major version. CDK8s+ is vended as a separate library for each Kubernetes spec version, all those libraries are now generally available and stable to use.</p>
<p>Customers also want to validate their manifest by applying either community or organisational policies. CDK8s now supports integration with third-party tools that facilitate this, and can perform validation as part of the synthesis process. This supports manifests produced by CDK8s adhering to the necessary policies.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about this, check out this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/26m">Announcing general availability of cdk8s+ and support for manifest validation</a> from Shimon Tolts, CEO and Co-Founder of Datree. The post shows you a few examples of how cdk8s+ can simplify the authoring of Kubernetes manifests, and how cdk8s+ can integrate with third-party policy enforcement tools (such as Datree), to provide a guardrail that protects your manifests against misconfigurations, and prevent them from reaching your cluster.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL now support 15 read replicas per instance, including up to 5 cross region read replicas, delivering up to 3X the previous read capacity.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for Amazon RDS database (DB) instances. They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB instance and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput. For disaster recovery, read replicas can be promoted when needed to become standalone DB instances.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>
<p>Announced this week was up to 10x faster exports to Amazon S3 for snapshot exports for Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition for MySQL 5.7 and 8.0. The performance improvement is automatically applied to all types of database snapshot exports, including manual snapshots, automated system snapshots, and snapshots created by the AWS Backup service.</p>
<p>With this capability, customers can export data up to 10x faster from an Amazon Aurora database and store it in an Amazon S3 bucket using AWS CLI or AWS Management Console. After the data is exported, they can analyze the exported data using Amazon Athena and/or other tools and services. The export process runs in the background and doesn&rsquo;t affect the performance of active database instances.</p>
<p><strong>Apache CloudStack</strong></p>
<p>Apache CloudStack, a project of the Apache Software Foundation, is open source software designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Anywhere on Apache CloudStack was announced last week, and this expands the choice of infrastructure options for customers running Kubernetes on-premises. Apache CloudStack enhances the list of deployment options for Amazon EKS Anywhere customers, which already includes bare metal servers and VMware vSphere.</p>
<p>While developing this new feature, we collaborated with the Apache CloudStack community to build the Cluster API provider for Apache CloudStack (CAPC), which has now joined the Kubernetes SIG. Amazon EKS Anywhere leverages CAPC to provide customers declarative, Kubernetes-style APIs for cluster creation, configuration, and management.</p>
<p><strong>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</strong></p>
<p>In addition to Bottlerocket and Ubuntu, you can now use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and have broader choice of operating systems to create and operate Amazon EKS Anywhere clusters in your on-premises data centres. RHEL support is available for Amazon EKS Anywhere clusters running on VMware vSphere, on Apache CloudStack, or directly on bare metal servers.</p>
<p>RHEL is a popular operating system for on-premises workloads, and customers often customize their RHEL images with security hardening and other organisational best practices. Now, you can start from your custom base images, and use Amazon EKS Anywhere tooling to build RHEL images for running Kubernetes clusters.</p>
