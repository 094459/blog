<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Please please please take 1 minute to <a href="https://pulse.buildon.aws/survey/PJRTOUMK">complete this short survey</a> and bask in the warmth of having helped improve how we support open source.</p>
<h3 id="celebrating-open-source-contributors">Celebrating open source contributors</h3>
<p>The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created.</p>
<p>So thank you to the following open source heroes: Nithya Ruff , Nick Karpov, Chandrapal Badshah, Walter McCain II, Kyaw Soe Hlaing, Sai Kiran Akula, Samiullah Mohammed, Masudur Rahaman Sayem, Akeef Khan, Bret Edwards, Roger Welin, Brittan DeYoung, Roberson Andrade, Damon Cortesi,  Arthur Petitpierre, Andrea Cavagna, Sheetal Joshi and Sai Vennam</p>
<h3 id="latest-open-source-projects">Latest open source projects</h3>
<p><em>The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.</em></p>
<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>
<p><strong>cfnctl</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2ox">cfnctl</a>  [[ pronounced cfn control or cloudformation control ]] is a great tool from Roger Welin that provides a CLI that brings the Terraform cli experience to Cloudformation. With cfnctl, you write Cloudformation templates as usual but use the cli workflow that you are already used to from Terraform, including: apply, plan, destroy, and output. Still work in progress, so why not give this a try and provide Roger feedback, or even better contribute back to the project. Very neat indeed!</p>

<p><strong>ckia</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2oy">ckia</a> is a new tool from Brittan DeYoung that provides an open source alternative to AWS Trusted Advisor, that is intended to run opinionated checks against your cloud environment and provide recommendations. The full suite of AWS trusted advisor checks is the inspiration for this project. The current focus for the project is providing check parity with the current AWS Trusted Advisor offerings, but the README does state that this is early days for the project. It is worth <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2ph">reading the Reddit thread</a> where Brittan discusses why he created this tool and how it compares to others that provide similar capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>AWS_ED</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2oz">AWS_ED</a> is a new project from Bret Edwards that I seemed to have missed when it was first published (sorry Bret!)  is intended to allow you to leverage your own Domain name to keep track of your public IP address. If you are a residential customer or you are a small/medium business that does not have a static IP at your office and you want to be able to access resources remotely, this is something you may want to leverage. It uses AWS&rsquo;s Route53 platform to update your personal IP address dynamically. This tool will track your IP address locally and if it detects a change in your IP, it will make a call to route53 using boto and update your resource record (your &ldquo;A&rdquo; name record) for your domain. This currently assumes that you are using a subdomain instead of using the Apex record.</p>
<p><strong>pg_gpt</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p0">pg_gpt</a> is an experimental extension from the lovely folks at Cloudquery that brings OpenAI API to your PostgreSQL to run queries in human language. Check out the details and the short demo they have put together. You will need to have an OPENAI API key to use this, and as the README states, do not use this for production as the plugin does send the schema info to OpenAI.</p>

<p><strong>aiws</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p1">aiws</a> is another project that has been inspired by ChatGPT, this time Hüseyin BABAL has put together this tool that provides an AI driven AWS CLI to help you to generate and use AWS commands to manage your resources in AWS. You will need to have an OPENAI API key to use this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1237982/228968604-953dd131-ba9d-47dd-a8d0-19bf59e37664.gif" alt="demo of aiws"></p>
<p><strong>cw-logs-insights-gpt</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p2">cw-logs-insights-gpt</a> is the final project this week that looks to integrate chatGPT, this time it is AWS Community Builder Lars Jacobsson who has put together this Chrome extension that generates CloudWatch Logs Insights queries from ChatGPT prompts. As with the other projects that feature chatGPT, you need to bring your OpenAI key to use this. I have to say that I think this is a very useful tool, as I always end up having to google these so this is going to save me a lot of time/effort. Lars is our special guest in the next episode of Build on Open Source, so make sure you put that on your calendar as he will be talking about some of his open source projects.</p>

<p><strong>transformers-neuronx</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p3">transformers-neuronx</a> is an open-source library built by the AWS Neuron team that helps run transformer decoder inference workflows using the AWS Neuron SDK. Currently, it has examples for the GPT2, GPT-J, and OPT model types. Find out more how you can use this project to optimise how you run those models using AWS silicon innovations such as AWS Inferentia and AWS Trainium by reading the post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pi">Deploy large language models on AWS Inferentia2 using large model inference containers</a>.</p>

<h3 id="demos-samples-solutions-and-workshops">Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops</h3>
<p><strong>semantic-search-aws-docs</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p6">semantic-search-aws-docs</a> this is a very promising sample project that demonstrates how to set up AWS infrastructure to perform semantic search and question answering on documents using a transformer machine learning models like BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT (via the Haystack open source framework). What do you think of these kinds of tools to help you find what you are looking for in your documentation? I would love to know as I am putting together some thoughts in this area.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/semantic-search-aws-docs/main/appdemo.gif" alt="demo of semantic search of aws docs"></p>
<p><strong>aws-chime-chat-demo</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p4">aws-chime-chat-demo</a> is a side-project that  Roberson Andrade has been working on that provides an example of how to build a chat for real-time messaging using AWS Chime Messaging service.  From his <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pj">Reddit post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of this project is to use it as a reference for a future developer-friendly guide on how to use this Amazon service. I believe it would be of great use since there are not many projects created for this purpose for Chime Messaging.</p>
<p>The main point of the project is to create a demo of a real application that uses AWS Chime Messaging service to work with real-time messaging, using the AWS infrastructure itself. For this, a simple React frontend was developed using the Chakra UI component library to accelerate development. For message rendering, the React Virtuoso library was used to generate a virtualized list and enable infinite scrolling, loading messages as the user scrolls.</p>
<p>To enable communication between the frontend and Chime, temporary AWS credentials need to be generated. For this, the authentication service offered by Cognito and the generation of credentials through the Cognito Identity Pool were used. Finally, to perform the action of creating a user in Chime Messaging, a trigger was configured that invokes a lambda when a Cognito account is confirmed. To create this entire infrastructure, Terraform was used as an IaC (Infrastructure as code) platform to facilitate the creation, modification, and destruction of all infrastructure created in AWS. To exemplify the application flow, I created a diagram that shows the entire user creation flow and communication between AWS services, as well as a video that shows the application in action,.</p>

<p><strong>emr-cli-examples</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p5">emr-cli-examples</a> is a repo from colleague Damon Cortesi that provide examples on how to use another project <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2ly">amazon-emr-cli</a> that he put together and we shared in <a href="https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-148-5h2b">#148</a>. These examples show how EMR CLI can be used to easily deploy a variety of different jobs to EMR Serverless and EMR on EC2. So dive in and explore the varied ways that you can deploy PySpark code to EMR and how the EMR CLI can make it all as easy as a single command.</p>
<p><em>Bonus</em></p>
<p>When I put demos together, I am often having to work with files that contain data. Those files are very often CSV formatted, and have always looked out for a good primer on how to optimise working with this kind of source data. Well, I need look no longer as Damon has put together this very cool tutorial, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pg">Intro to Data Processing on AWS</a> that shows what happens when you read both raw (TSV) and optimised (Apache Parquet) data from S3 using Apache Spark.

<p><strong>Delta Lake</strong></p>
<p>Nick Karpov has put together this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pe">Introducing Support for Delta Lake Tables in AWS Lambda</a> that shares news about how the AWS SDK for pandas (what was formally AWS Data Wrangler) and how it now supports the deltalake package for read and write access to Delta Lake tables. The post provides a nice walk through to get you started and show you how you can build your own Lambda layer with deltalake. [hands on]</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Custodian</strong></p>
<p>Cloud Custodian is an open source project that enables you to manage your cloud resources by filtering, tagging, and then applying actions to them. Chandrapal Badshah has put together a blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2pd">My Love/Hate Relationship with Cloud Custodian</a> where he shares his experiences in working with this open source tool over the past year. If you are thinking about using this project, or maybe a seasoned user, take a look and see what you think.</p>
<p><strong>gMSA on Linux</strong></p>
<p>group Managed Service Account (gMSA) is an open sourced credentials-fetcher daemon, that allows Linux users (initial support on Amazon Linux 2023, Fedora Linux 36, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9) to integrate with Microsoft Active Directory and use Microsoft AD group Managed Service Accounts capability. In this post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p8">AWS Now Supports Credentials-fetcher for gMSA on Amazon Linux 2023 </a> Walter McCain II, Kyaw Soe Hlaing, Sai Kiran Akula, and Samiullah Mohammed share more details on the use cases they see, and provide an example of   using an Active Directory domain joined Linux server with gMSA. Warning, may contain Windows! [hands on]</p>

<p><strong>Apache Airflow</strong></p>
<p>You can now create Apache Airflow version 2.5 environments on Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). Apache Airflow 2.5 is the latest minor release of the popular open-source tool that helps customers author, schedule, and monitor workflows. With Apache Airflow version 2.5 on Amazon MWAA, customers can enjoy the same scalability, availability, security, and ease of management that Amazon MWAA offers with the improvements of Apache Airflow 2.5, such as annotations for DAG runs and task instances, auto-refresh for task log view, and a better dataset user-interface. Apache Airflow version 2.5 on Amazon MWAA includes Python version 3.10 and comes pre-installed with recently released Amazon Provider Package version 7.1.0, enabling access to new AWS integrations, such as Amazon SageMaker Pipelines, Amazon SageMaker Model Registry, and Amazon EMR Notebooks.</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>A few updates this week for PostgreSQL users.</p>
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL now supports Amazon RDS Optimized Reads for up to two times faster query processing compared to previous generation instances. Complex queries that utilise temporary tables, such as queries involving sorts, hash aggregations, high-load joins, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) can now execute up to two times faster with Optimized Reads on RDS for PostgreSQL. Optimized Read-enabled instances achieve faster query processing by placing temporary tables generated by PostgreSQL on the local NVMe-based SSD block-level storage, thereby reducing your traffic to Elastic Block Storage (EBS) over the network. Refer to our recent blog post to learn more about performance improvements using local disk based database instances for workloads that have highly concurrent read/write processing. Amazon RDS Optimized Reads is available by default on RDS for PostgreSQL versions 15.2 and higher, 14.7 and higher, and 13.10 and higher. This feature is now available on Intel-based M5d and R5d instances with up to 3,600 GiB of NVMe-based-SSD block-level storage and AWS Graviton2-based M6gd and R6gd database (DB) instances with up to 3,800 GiB of NVMe-based SSD block-level storage and up to 25 Gbps of network bandwidth. You can configure these disk based DB instances as Multi-AZ DB cluster, Multi-AZ DB instances, and Single-AZ DB instances.</p>
<p>If you want to dive deeper, make sure you read the blog post from Naga Appani, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2p7">Introducing Optimized Reads for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition now supports PostgreSQL major version 15 (15.2). New features in PostgreSQL 15 include the SQL standard &ldquo;MERGE&rdquo; command for conditional SQL queries, performance improvements for both in-memory and disk-based sorting, and support for two-phase commit and row/column filtering for logical replication.</p>
<p>Following the open source community announcement of updates to the PostgreSQL database, we updated Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition to support PostgreSQL 14.7, 13.10, 12.14, and 11.19. These releases contain bug fixes and improvements by the PostgreSQL community. Refer to the Aurora version policy to help you decide how often and how to plan your upgrade. As a reminder, if you are running any version of Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL 11, you must upgrade to a newer major version by January 31, 2024. This release contains optimisations that improve database availability during patching or minor version upgrades. The optimisations will be used when applying patches or newer minor version upgrades to Aurora PostgreSQL versions 11.18 or higher, 12.13 or higher, 13.9 or higher, or 14.6 or higher. This release also contains logical replication performance improvements and new features for Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL version 3.1.</p>
<p><strong>MySQL</strong></p>
<p>A couple of important updates from last week.</p>
<p>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL now supports inbound replication from Amazon RDS Single-AZ database (DB) instances and Amazon RDS Multi-AZ DB instances with one standby to Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments with two readable standby database (DB) instances. You can use this inbound replication to help migrate your existing Amazon RDS MySQL deployments within minutes to Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments with two readable standby db instances, which has one writer instance and two readable standby instances across three availability zones. By creating a Multi-AZ deployment with two readable standby db instances as a read replica of your existing RDS MySQL database instance, you can promote the read replica to be your new primary, typically within minutes.  Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. Deployment of Amazon RDS Multi-AZ with two readable standby database instances supports up to 2x faster transaction commit latencies than a Multi-AZ deployment with one standby instance. In this configuration, automated failovers typically take under 35 seconds. In addition, the two readable standbys can also serve read traffic without needing to attach additional read replicas.</p>
<p>Amazon RDS for MySQL now supports up to 15 asynchronous read replicas from Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments with two readable standbys delivering up to 8x the previous read capacity. Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments with two readable standbys have one writer instance and two readable standby instances across three availability zones. You can now create 15 additional asynchronous read replicas outside the cluster in addition to the two reader instances thereby scaling up your read capacity to 17 instances. Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database (DB) instances. For read heavy database workloads, the additional read replicas provide the option to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of the two readable instances inside the Multi-AZ deployment with two readable standbys. You can create one or more read replicas and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput. Read replicas can also be promoted and modified to be a Multi-AZ deployment option with two readable standbys when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong></p>
<p>Last week we announced support for Apache Spark with Java 11 in EMR on EKS. Amazon EMR on EKS enables customers to run open-source big data frameworks such as Apache Spark on Amazon EKS. AWS customers can now leverage Java 11 as a supported Java runtime to run Spark workloads on Amazon EMR on EKS. Until now, Amazon EMR on EKS ran Spark with Java 8 as the default Java runtime. In order to run Spark with Java 11, customers will need to create a custom image and install the Java 11 runtime to replace the default Java 8. This required additional engineering effort when the customer first started to use Amazon EMR on EKS and when the customer upgraded to a new release version. With this new feature, Amazon EMR on EKS supports launching Spark with Java 11 runtime by simply passing in a new release label.</p>
