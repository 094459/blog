<meta name="twitter:description" content="August 24th - Instalment #32 Week No.32 and after two weeks taking some time off visiting sunny Scotland, I return refreshed with a bumper edition with the pick of posts from the past few weeks. As always, some great posts and projects as well as some events you might want to add to your diary and a few customer case studies for you to check out.
Your feedback matters! I have put together a short feedback survey, which I would ask you to take - it will take no more than 2 minutes."/>

<p><strong>http-desync-guardian</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aws/http-desync-guardian">http-desync-guardian</a> is a new open source library from AWS that provides a way for you to analyse HTTP requests to minimize risks of HTTP Desync attacks. HTTP/1.1 went through a long evolution since 1991 to 2014, which means there is a variety of servers and clients, which might have different views on request boundaries, creating opportunities for desynchronisation attacks (a.k.a. HTTP Desync). <strong>http_desync_guardian</strong> library is designed to analyze HTTP requests to prevent HTTP Desync attacks, balancing security and availability. It classifies requests into different categories and provides recommendations on how each tier should be handled.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1295461636241854469?s=11">this Twitter thread</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc">Colm MacCárthaigh</a> for additional details, as well as this post from Jessica Haworth <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/aws-launches-open-source-tool-to-protect-against-http-request-smuggling-attacks">AWS launches open source tool to protect against HTTP request smuggling attacks</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SpaceSiren</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/spacesiren/spacesiren">SpaceSiren</a> is an open source project that provides a honey token management and alert system for AWS. It allows you to create these honey tokens at scale, managing tens of thousands with close to no cost (they provide some cost guidelines, at approx $1-$5 per month). The project provides an an API Gateway to create no-permission AWS IAM users and access keys for those users. You sprinkle the access keys wherever you like, for example in proprietary code or private data stores, and if one of those sources gets breached, an attacker is likely to use the stolen key to see what they can do with it. You will receive an alert via email, PagerDuty, Slack and Pushover that someone attempted to use the key.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/spacesiren/spacesiren/raw/master/docs/images/screenshots/token-api.png" alt="honey"></p>
<p>Great documentation and installation instructions (as well as automated deployment via Terraform) makes this a project you should check out.</p>
<p><strong>Serverless Video Processing</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cbttrevor/aws-serverless-video-processor">Serverless Video Processor</a> is an open source project from Trevor Sullivan that helps you build a solution to perform video conversions using AWS Fargate, triggered by uploads to an Amazon S3 Bucket. Trevor provides a video to help you build this, so you can use this as the base for your own projects or applications.</p>
<p><strong>Pulse Oximetry tracker</strong></p>

<p><strong>Horovod</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/multi-gpu-and-distributed-training-using-horovod-in-amazon-sagemaker-pipe-mode/">Multi-GPU and distributed training using Horovod in Amazon SageMaker Pipe mode</a> from Muhyun Kim, Hussain Karimi, and Jiyang Kang introduces what Horovod is and how you can run this in a number of different scenarios to provide efficient mutli-GPU and multi-node distributed training on Amazon SageMaker.</p>
<p>Horovod is Uber’s open-source framework for distributed deep learning, and it’s available for use with most popular deep learning toolkits like TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet. Why do you need this? When you train a model with a large amount of data, you should distribute the training across multiple GPUs on either a single instance or multiple instances. Deep learning frameworks provide their own methods to support multi-GPU training or distributed training, and Horovod emerged as an open source way to do this.</p>
<p>This post walks you through how to set this up and provide a GitHub repo with the resources you need to get started.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Chalice</strong></p>
<p>A couple of posts on AWS Chalice this week from by James Saryerwinnie.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/introducing-the-new-test-client-for-aws-chalice/">Introducing the AWS Chalice test client</a> introduces the latest release of AWS Chalice, v1.17.0, that now includes a test client that enables you to write tests for your Chalice applications using a concise and simplified API. The test client handles all the boilerplate setup and teardown logic that you’d previously have to write yourself when testing your Chalice applications. This posts shows you how to get started with this new update. In the second post,</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/using-aws-lambda-layers-with-aws-chalice/">Using AWS Lambda Layers with AWS Chalice</a> James looks at version 1.18.0 of Chalice, which now has support for Chalice to automatically manage a shared Lambda layer that contains all your third-party and vendor code. Lambda layers are a way to pull in additional dependencies in code that are separate from the deployment package for a Lambda function. These Lambda layers can be reused by multiple Lambda functions, which allows you to keep your deployment packages small as well as reduce the total storage space needed for all your Lambda functions.</p>

<p><strong>cfn-guard</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/write-preventive-compliance-rules-for-aws-cloudformation-templates-the-cfn-guard-way/">Write preventive compliance rules for AWS CloudFormation templates the cfn-guard way</a> from  Luis Colon, Raisa Hashem, and Josh Joy helps you get started with creating some compliance rules using the open source tool cfn-guard.</p>
<p>CloudFormation helps customers model and provision their AWS and third-party application resources, with features such as rollback to provide automation and safety. Together with tools such as AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodePipeline, and AWS CodeDeploy, CloudFormation helps customers automate processes that implement popular practices like GitFlow , allowing for incremental testing and automated guardrails for fast releases. Emerging best practices, such as DevSecOps, shift-left testing and low-code tools, are further enabling security leaders to embed preventive compliance rules earlier in the development lifecycle.</p>
<p>These best practices inspired us to build CloudFormation Guard (cfn-guard) as an open-source tool that helps you write compliance rules using a simple, policy as code language. It will help you validate CloudFormation templates against those rules to keep your AWS resources in compliance with your company policy guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Swfit and AWS Amplify</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/using-swift-combine-with-aws-amplify/">Using Swift Combine with AWS Amplify</a> this post from Kyle Lee introduces the support included in AWS Amplify 1.1 release for IOS of Combine. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine">Combine</a> is a first party reactive framework that makes it easy to deal with asynchronous events in a declarative way.</p>
<p>The previous 1.0 version of Amplify iOS (launched in May 2020) supported only a standard &lsquo;“callback” model for handing asynchronous calls. While this is a common pattern for iOS developers, it leads to a well-known condition known as “callback hell”, where dependent asynchronous calls are nested within callbacks. For anything beyond simple dependency cases, this quickly becomes difficult to follow and maintain. With Amplify iOS 1.1, developers can now flatten this nest of callbacks using the built-in integration with the Combine framework. Support is included for all the asynchronous APIs in Amplify iOS, including Auth (sign up, sign in, observing session status), DataStore (CRUD operations, observing changes), and Storage (uploading and downloading files), among others.</p>
<p>In this post Kyle helps you get started and walks you through some use cases and sample code.</p>
