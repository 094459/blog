    <h1>AWS open source news and updates No.47</h1>
    <h2 id="december-7th---instalment-47">December 7th - Instalment #47</h2>
<p>Week No.47 and with the first week of re:Invent over, it was good to see so many great open source related announcements. You can expected detailed coverage of those in this weeks roundup, including links to the various sessions and blog posts that have been published this week to support those announcements. If that was not enough, this week still has a great round up of other open source blog posts, some really interesting open source projects and of course, more posts from the community. You should also check out the new design for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/">AWS open source webpage</a>. Looking rather nice I think, and you can expect more improvements over the coming months.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s crack on and start with what you can expect during week two of re:Invent.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/trollpursepublishing/trollpurse-ops">trollpurse-ops</a> this project provides a low server management model (commonly known as &ldquo;serverless&rdquo;) for managing Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) for common source control management services, popular game engines, and well known storefronts for video games and game related products. This has been put together by the community behind <a href="https://trollpurse.com/">https://trollpurse.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>red-detector</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lightspin-tech/red-detector">red-detector</a> is an open source tool from <a href="https://lightspin.io/">Lightspin</a> that lets you scan your EC2 instance to find its vulnerabilities using another open source tool called <a href="https://vuls.io/en/">Vuls</a>.</p>
<p><strong>serverless-express</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vendia/serverless-express">serverless-express</a> this is not a new project but this has now moved to a new home. If you were using this project to build your serverless web applications or services, check out the new home. From the GitHub repo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brett, the original creator of the Serverless Express library, will continue maintaining the repository and give it the attention and care it deserves. At the same time, we will be looking for additional contributors to participate in the development and stewardship of the Serverless Express library. AWS and the SAM team will remain involved in an administrative role alongside Vendia, Brett, and the new maintainers that will join the project.</p>
<p>We believe this is the best course of action to ensure that customers using this library get the best possible support in the future. To learn more about this move or become a maintainer of the new Serverless Express library, reach out to us through a GitHub issue on this repository.</p>

<h3 id="reinvent">re:Invent</h3>
<p><strong>Announcements and Keynotes</strong></p>
<p>Whilst not exclusively open source, if you did miss the re:Invent keynote from Andy Jassy, then check out Jeff Barr&rsquo;s realtime blogging of the event, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/reinvent-2020-liveblog-andy-jassy-keynote/">re:Invent 2020 Liveblog</a>. He expertly captures everything you need to know, including the stuff I am going to talk about below.</p>
<p>There were a number of great announcements around enhancements to AWS Lambda, which quickly prompted updates to a couple of open source projects in this space. Alex Casalboni updated his <a href="https://github.com/alexcasalboni/aws-lambda-power-tuning">AWS Lambda Power Tuning tool</a> to incorporate the millisecond billing and new higher limits, and it was great to welcome a new contributor to the project as well. Congratulations Celete Blackwell on your <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_casalboni/status/1334543668615720967">contributions</a>. You know have even more ways to deploy AWS Lambda Power Tuning, so if you are using Terraform then this new update from Celete is going to be very handy indeed. The AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) also had a <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/releases/tag/v1.13.1">new release, v1.13.1</a> which you should check out.</p>
<p><strong>EKS Anywhere</strong></p>
<p>EKS Distro is a distribution of the same version of Kubernetes deployed by Amazon EKS, which you can use to manually create your own Kubernetes clusters anywhere you choose. This generated a lot of buzz on Tuesday, so want to share some of what has been written and no doubt will add to that over the coming weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-distro-the-kubernetes-distribution-used-by-amazon-eks/">Amazon EKS Distro: The Kubernetes Distribution Used by Amazon EKS</a> from Martin Beeby is an intro and walks you how to get started including what you need to know, pricing and support information as well as what is coming soon. Allan Naim, Chandler Hoisington, Raja Jadeja, Micah Hausler, and Michael Hausenblas collaborate on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-amazon-eks-distro/">Introducing Amazon EKS Distro (EKS-D)</a> taking a closer look at what EKS Distro really is, the different ways to get started with EKS Distro and a look at some of the partner ecosystem you can already work with.</p>
<p>In the post <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-amazon-eks-add-ons/">Introducing Amazon EKS add-ons: lifecycle management for Kubernetes operational software</a> Nathan Taber and Jesse Butler share with you how you can easily add within your Amazon EKS clusters new add-ons that provide key functionality to support your Kubernetes applications. These add-ons include critical tools for cluster networking like the Amazon VPC CNI, as well as operational software for observability, management, scaling, and security. This looks at this in detail, how to set it up and how it works and then shares what you can expect early next year.</p>
<p>A related session which will be important for folks who running Amazon EKS is how to make sure you understand and follow security best practices. In this session, <a href="https://virtual.awsevents.com/media/1_fqz5r4ul">Securing your Amazon EKS applications: Best practices</a> Jeremy Cowan walks you through the onion defence in depth model of how to approach this. Good session that if you are using containers you should be familiar with.</p>
<p>With EKS Anywhere, the containers team were excited to share an update to the Amazon EKS console. In <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/introducing-the-new-amazon-eks-console/">Introducing the new Amazon EKS console</a> Nathan Taber and Jesse Butler provide an breakdown of what the new experience looks like, which will work with your EKS clusters whether they are in the cloud or you are deploying them somewhere else as part of the EKS-Distro (EKS-D)</p>
<p>Make sure you check out the Containers from the Couch folk with their unboxing video which you can find on their You Tube page,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUS_LrlctHI">Unboxing EKS Distro</a> which is airing on December 7th.</p>
<p>At AWS we are customer obsessed and we work back from the customer and invent on their behalf. We use mechanisms like Working Backwards and we start by writing a press release before we begin the hard technical work. If you are interested in reading the Press Release for these new releases, check them out on the Amazon Day One blog, <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aws-announces-four-new-container-capabilities">AWS Announces Four New Container Capabilities</a></p>

<p><strong>Babelfish for Aurora PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<p>How do you help shift the inertia and generate momentum when it comes to moving from proprietary to open source databases? When  enterprises have spent years building data models in something like Microsoft SQL Server that change can feel hard. Matt Asay&rsquo;s post offers a ray of hope and might be the catalyst you are looking for in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/want-more-postgresql-you-just-might-like-babelfish/">Want more PostgreSQL? You just might like Babelfish</a>. This was probably my favourite announcement from Andy&rsquo;s keynote, and make sure you check out the sessions below that talk in more detail as well as provide a pretty cool demo of this in action.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Amplify</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-amplify-admin-ui-helps-you-develop-app-backends-no-cloud-experience-required/">New AWS Amplify Admin UI Helps You Develop App Backends, No Cloud Experience Required</a> Marcia Villalba writes about a great new feature that I think a LOT of AWS Amplify developers are going to love. The introduction of a new capability to provide an admin screen/section feature to the applications you develop. Marcia uses a great example of a restaurant app where you might want to give the owner the ability to add/change new items to the menu. Whilst there are many ways you can achieve this, you can now uses the Admin UI in AWS Amplify to easily incorporate this. Find out more by reading Marcia&rsquo;s walkthrough.</p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>AWS Security Hub</strong></p>
<p>AWS Security Hub can now automatically receive findings from the open source tool Kube-bench Kube-bench checks whether your Kubernetes cluster is configured in accordance with the recommendations from the Center for Internet Security (CIS), supporting both the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark and the CIS Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Benchmark. Kube-bench’s findings about non-compliant configuration settings can be viewed within Security Hub. In addition, Security Hub’s integration with Cloud Custodian is now available in the AWS China (Beijing) Region operated by Sinnet and in the AWS China (Ningxia) Region operated by NWCD. The open source tool Cloud Custodian can both send and receive findings to/from Security Hub. This brings the total number of AWS service and AWS Partner Network (APN) Technology Partner integrations available in Security Hub to 61.</p>
<p><strong>Elasticsearch</strong></p>
<p>You can now use Amazon Elasticsearch Service as a target data store with AWS Glue Elastic Views. Now in limited preview, AWS Glue Elastic Views is a new capability of AWS Glue that makes it easy to combine and replicate data across multiple data stores without you having to write custom code. With AWS Glue Elastic Views, you can use familiar Structured Query Language (SQL) to quickly create a virtual table—called a view—from multiple different source data stores. Based on this view, AWS Glue Elastic Views copies data from each source data store and creates a replica—called a materialized view—in a target data store. AWS Glue Elastic Views monitors for changes to data in your source data stores continuously, and provides updates to your target data stores automatically, ensuring data accessed through the materialized view is always up-to-date.</p>
<p>With AWS Glue Elastic Views, you can now create views over data in Amazon DynamoDB and materialize these views in Amazon Elasticsearch Service. This enables you to use DynamoDB to as a key-value and document database with single-digit millisecond performance, and seamless integrate it with Amazon Elasticsearch Service to provide fast and relevant search experiences for your customers–without writing any code. AWS Glue Elastic Views is serverless and scales capacity up or down automatically based on demand, so there’s no infrastructure to manage.</p>
