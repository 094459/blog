  <title>AWS open source news and updates #79 | Beachgeek blog - a refuge for pineapple on pizza lovers</title>

<meta name="twitter:description" content="August 27th, 2021 - Instalment #79 Newsletter #79.
The combination of having been away on PTO for the past few weeks, and this coming Monday being a national holiday in the UK, I thought I would post the newsletter today. Covering nearly three weeks, a lot has happened so there is a lot to cover.
We have 17 new open source projects and solutions, including EventBridge Canon, an essential project if you are working with event driven architectures on AWS, kics a security scanning tool for your IaC, open source solutions such as aws-security-analytics-bootstrap and amazon-msk-with-apache-kafka-streams-api, and other new projects like aws-python-utilities, snap-xcompile, riFT, rds_iamauth_proxy, aws-simple-websocket, ecs-external-instance-network-sentry and more."/>

<p>Newsletter #79.</p>
<p>The combination of having been away on PTO for the past few weeks, and this coming Monday being a national holiday in the UK, I thought I would post the newsletter today. Covering nearly three weeks, a lot has happened so there is a lot to cover.</p>
<p>We have 17 new open source projects and solutions, including EventBridge Canon, an essential project if you are working with event driven architectures on AWS, kics a security scanning tool for your IaC,  open source solutions such as aws-security-analytics-bootstrap and amazon-msk-with-apache-kafka-streams-api, and other new projects like aws-python-utilities, snap-xcompile, riFT,  rds_iamauth_proxy, aws-simple-websocket, ecs-external-instance-network-sentry and more.</p>
<p>We have a wide selection of great blog posts/tutorials too, with Apache Airflow, Redis, OpenTelemetry having several great posts and walk throughs. Other topics covered this week include Amundsen, Prometheus, AWS CDK, OpenSearch, Apache ActiveMQ, Apache Jena, Apache Spark, Suricata, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and for folks interested in all things containers, we have Bottlerocket, Docker and Kubernetes updates and posts.</p>
<p>We will resume with the Monday releases next time.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
<p>Please let me know how you found this newsletter - how could I improve it or what would you like to see that is not currently covered? It will take you all of 60 seconds, so <a href="https://eventbox.dev/survey/6JGUUJK">Take the Survey</a> (the first 20 will get $25 AWS credit codes too!)</p>

<p><strong>Big Data - Debezium/Apicurio and Apache Kafka</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to Big Data blog posts, I always enjoy working through Gary Staffords posts. In his latest, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/uc">Hydrating a Data Lake using Log-based Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium, Apicurio, and Kafka Connect on AWS</a>, building on from an earlier post (that you should also check out) this post dives deep into log-based CDC as a marked improvement over query-based CDC to continuously stream changes from the PostgreSQL database to your data lake.  Gary explores a number of open source technologies, performing log-based CDC using Debezium, storing messages as Apache Avro, with Avro message schemas stored in Apicurio Registry. This is what you will build following this post:</p>

<p><strong>Kubernetes</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) now supports the Multus Container Networking Interface (CNI) plugin, enabling pods running in EKS clusters to attach multiple network interfaces in support of advanced networking configurations.</p>
<p>Multus is an open source CNI plugin for Kubernetes that enables attaching multiple network interfaces to pods. Multus acts as a meta plugin, invoking additional CNI plugins that can operate on multiple network interfaces attached to pods. Use cases that commonly require pods with multiple interfaces include running 5G and streaming networks on Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>AWS Copilot</strong></p>
<p>AWS Copilot announced the release of version 1.9. With this release, AWS Copilot now allows you to configure a friendly DNS name for your request driven web services deployed with AWS App Runner. This feature was already available for load balanced web services deployed with Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Customers using AWS App Runner can now provide a friendly DNS name, such as api.example.com, directly in the manifest file and AWS Copilot will provision and manage the necessary infrastructure to associate the domain name with the customer’s service deployed with App Runner.</p>
<p>AWS Copilot v1.9 also adds support for creating multiple environments in the same Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). This enables customers to save costs during development stages by sharing a single VPC across multiple AWS Copilot environments. By default, AWS Copilot will continue to to create separate VPCs for each environment. Furthermore, with this release, AWS Copilot now automatically sets the Docker default platform to be linux/amd64 to improve compatibility with customers’ ARM-based machines.</p>
<p><strong>Next.js</strong></p>
<p>AWS Amplify Hosting now supports deploying and hosting server-side rendered (SSR) apps built with version 11 of Next.js with zero configuration. Amplify Hosting supports all the latest Next.js features including incremental static regeneration, automatic image optimisation, and script optimisation.</p>
