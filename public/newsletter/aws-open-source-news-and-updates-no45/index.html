    <h1>AWS open source news and updates No.45</h1>
    <h2 id="november-23rd---instalment-45">November 23rd - Instalment #45</h2>
<p>Week No.45 and this is the last edition before re:Invent so look out this week for some blog posts sharing news about the open source track and open source sessions at re:Invent this year. This week we have another great selection of posts, projects and more. Make sure you check out the Karpenter project that was announced last week during AWS Container Day at KubeCon, a great selection of Kubernetes/container related posts and some more great posts on AWS Graviton2 and Nitro Enclaves.</p>
<p>A reminder that the<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/aws-architecture-monthly-magazine-open-source/"> Architecture Monthly Magazine: Open Source</a> came out last week. Plenty of great stuff in there, from Ask an Expert, case studies, reference architectures, white papers and more. Fits perfectly in your Kindle, whichever version you have.</p>
<p><strong>Open Source Job of the Week</strong></p>
<p>We are still looking for applications, so if you fancy working with the AWS Amplify crew (I know, I know it means you will have to toil with the likes of Matt Auerbach and Nader Dabit) then check out this opening within their team. They are looking for folks excited about OSS to support Amplify developers in their GitHub repos and Discord channels. This is a great opportunity to work on the Amplify product team, and even better this is a remote role.</p>
<h3 id="celebrate-open-source-contributors">Celebrate open source contributors</h3>

AWS Data API&rsquo;s is an open source project that provides the ability to replace traditional database back ends for your applications with simple HTTP API&rsquo;s. They offer the speed, scalability, reliability, and security of a sophisticated NOSQL platform, but with zero coding and no servers to manage. In seconds, you can create a new Data API Namespace that includes your data model, natural language search, and sophisticated data lineage tracking which is presented to your application as an HTTPS REST API.</p>
<p><strong>global-load-test</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cagataygurturk/global-load-test">global-load-test</a> this open source project from AWS Community Hero Cagatay Gürtürk, is a command line tool that allows its users to load test HTTP(S) endpoints from seven geographical different regions leveraging AWS Route53 Health Checks against the endpoint and reports the latency from these regions. Cagatay provides some sample use cases in the README. Now this is not a new project, but speaking with him recently about why he created this and how you might use it he added &ldquo;I first created this project because I noticed I was using Route53 a lot to test our geo proximity routing and also measure latencies from different parts of the world, so I have decided to create this to automate that&rdquo; If this sounds like something you would find useful, why not check it out. Thanks Cagatay</p>
<p><strong>IAMFinder</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/prisma-cloud/IAMFinder">IAMFinder</a> is an open source tool that enumerates and finds users and IAM roles in a target AWS accounts, and using only the AWS account number IAMFinder is able to identify users and roles in that environment. You can read this post from Jay Chen, <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/iamfinder/">IAMFinder: Open Source Tool to Identify Information Leaked from AWS IAM Reconnaissance</a> to find out more about this tool and how it works.</p>

Patrick Leung and Alec Littlechild tackle the question around how do you approach modernising existing enterprise workloads you might have that you might typically always deploy on virtual machines? Using the example of SAP Commerce, they take you through how you can approach modernising these kinds of workloads.</p>
<p>Next up is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/implementing-runtime-security-in-amazon-eks-using-cncf-falco/">Implementing Runtime security in Amazon EKS using CNCF Falco</a> from Anand Krishna who demonstrates how you can set up an Amazon EKS cluster and configure runtime container security analysis and alerting with CNCF Falco and Amazon CloudWatch using custom dashboards and alarms. What is CNCF Falco? CNCF Falco is a runtime security tool for deep container security events analysis and alerts and  works in conjunction other AWS services such as Firelens and Amazon CloudWatch.  Falco continuously scans the containers running in the pods and sends the security, debug, or audit events as JSON format as STDOUT and this post explains in depth on how to install Falco and how to it works with other AWS services.</p>
<p>Steven David and Anuj Singh follow that post with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/open-source-calico-for-windows-containers-on-amazon-eks/">Open Source Calico for Windows Containers on Amazon EKS</a> where they walk you through a tutorial on how to install and use Calico for Windows containers running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).</p>

<p><strong>AWS AppSync</strong>
<strong>Real-Time Live Sports Updates</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/implementations/real-time-live-sports-updates-using-aws-appsync/">Real-Time Live Sports Updates Using AWS AppSync</a></p>
<p>This solution is designed to demonstrate a serverless solution that enables media customer to deliver real-time live sports updates to web and mobile application via AppSync subscriptions. Many companies in M&amp;E have mobile and web apps that enable their customers to view sports scores, track live game/match info, receive fantasy sports updates and enable their subscribers to chat. The common use cases for delivering real-time sports data to customers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A person is viewing a screen in the mobile or web app that is showing live game updates. An event occurs (e.g. goal scored, time left in game, player injured) and the M&amp;E company must push this to the view in the application.</li>
<li>In a fantasy sports league, the scores for a fantasy team are changing with each play in the game. Their points, standings, status in the head-to-head competition against another player in the fantasy league will continue to change. These changes are delivered to live viewers of the fantasy game.</li>
<li>Also, in fantasy sports, members of a league want to chat. They want to talk trash or banter with their friends. Building chat requires the right real-time platform.</li>
<li>When mobile app users do not have an app in the foreground, the M&amp;E company wants to deliver updates via a push notification. The solution must recognize whether a viewer is actively watching the live updates with the app in the foreground or the app is in the background. If the app is in the background, the live update should be delivered as a push notification.</li>

<p><strong>.NET on AWS Graviton2</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.azurefromthetrenches.com/compute-bang-for-buck-on-azure-and-aws/">Compute “Bang for Buck” on Azure and AWS – 20% to 40% advantage on AWS</a> another great benchmark post from James Randall (minus fractals this time, which is a shame). As James writes at the beginning of this post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It struck me there were some interesting differences across ARM, x86, Azure and AWS and I’ve expanded my testing and attempted here to present these findings in (hopefully) useful terms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warning, this post contains plenty of bar graphs and data points! If you are interested and want to maybe learn more as to how this can help you with your .NET workloads then make sure you contact James - he provides his contact details in this post.</p>
<p><strong>GraphQL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://theburningmonk.com/2020/11/how-i-built-a-social-network-in-4-weeks-with-graphql-and-serverless/">How I built a social network in 4 weeks with GraphQL and serverless</a> this latest post from AWS Serverless Hero Yan Cui shares a recent client project to help launch a new social network for university students to engage with each other to do sports. Yan shares some interesting details including the tech stack. Even better is Yan provides masterclass sessions where you can learn this stack and how to create your own solutions.

<p><a href="https://www.itscava.com/remote-access-to-ec2-instances-the-easy-and-secure-way">Remote access to EC2 instances. The easy (and secure) way</a> a few weeks ago I shared this open source project that allowed you to simplify how you managed ssh access to your AWS EC2 instances. I have been using it since, and I love it. I reminds me of my old favourite tool I used to use ages ago called SecureCRT in how easy it was to manage my secure sessions. Anyway, Andrea Cavagna has put this blog post together to show you how to get up and running with this tool.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605693914859/p1enNhguc.gif" alt="demo"></p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick Updates</h3>
<p>A round up of smaller updates and quick bites of open source goodness.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Flink</strong></p>
<p>A couple of items this week. First up, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink now provides access to the Apache Flink Dashboard, giving you greater visibility into your applications and advanced monitoring capabilities. You can now view your Apache Flink application’s environment variables, over 120 metrics, logs, and the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the Apache Flink application in a simple, contextualised user interface. Read more about this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/amazon-kinesis-data-analytics-now-supports-the-apache-flink-dashboard/">here</a>. The second item is that you can now build and run streaming applications using Apache Flink version 1.11 in Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink. Apache Flink v1.11 provides improvements to the Table and SQL API, which is a unified, relational API for stream and batch processing and acts as a superset of the SQL language specially designed for working with Apache Flink. Apache Flink v1.11 capabilities also include an improved memory model and RocksDB optimisations for increased application stability, and support for task manager stack traces in the Apache Flink Dashboard. With this launch, Kinesis Data Analytics supports JDK 11 and Scala 2.12, with support for Python coming soon. Read the full announcement <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/amazon-kinesis-data-analytics-now-supports-apache-flink/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>AWS ParallelCluster</strong></p>
<p>AWS ParallelCluster is a fully supported and maintained open source cluster management tool that makes it easy for scientists, researchers, and IT administrators to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS cloud. HPC clusters are collections of tightly coupled compute, storage, and networking resources that enable customers to run large scale scientific and engineering workloads. Significant feature enhancements to this latest release of AWS ParallelCluster include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for P4d instances: Customers can now select P4d instances for use in their clusters. These instances include support for NVIDIA GPUDirect Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) enabled through Elastic Fabric Adapter, which can accelerate tightly coupled applications using the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) for GPU-to-GPU communication. This option can be enabled using the new enable_efa_gdr configuration setting.</li>
<li>Support for the CentOS 8 Operating System: Customers can now choose CentOS 8 as their base operating system of choice to run their clusters for both x86 and Arm architectures. As with other operating systems supported by AWS ParallelCluster, you can choose your operating system using the base_os configuration option, and can also choose to create and use your own custom AMI built on top of CentOS 8. CentOS 8 support also includes compatibility with all of AWS ParallelCluster’s supported schedulers and NICE DCV for remote visualization.</li>
<li>Amazon CloudWatch Cluster Metrics Dashboard: Customers can track and visualize operational metrics for their clusters in CloudWatch. This includes metrics such as CPU and network utilization, file system read and write data operations, and read and write operations for Amazon Elastic Block Store volumes. Customers can use this dashboard to visualize cluster usage or identify performance bottlenecks to diagnose how best to improve cluster performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Elasticsearch</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Elasticsearch Service now supports the ability to reload dictionary files without reindexing your data. Elasticsearch uses analysers to convert string data into terms or tokens that power its search capabilities. These analysers can do things like remove white space and stop words, perform stemming, handle compound words, and add synonyms. Previously, on Amazon Elasticsearch Service these analysers could only process data as it was indexed. If you wanted to add some additional synonyms at a later time, you had to reindex your data with the new dictionary file. With the new hot reload capability, you can call analysers at search time, and your dictionary files augment the search results during the query. This feature also lets you version your dictionary files in Amazon Elasticsearch Service and update them on your domains, also without having to reindex your data.</p>
<p>This feature is powered by Open Distro for Elasticsearch, an Apache 2.0-licensed distribution of Elasticsearch. To learn more about Open Distro for Elasticsearch and this feature, visit the <a href="https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/">project website</a>.</p>
<p>Hot reload of dictionary files is available on any Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain running Elasticsearch 7.8 or later. To learn more, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/custom-packages.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>AWS CDK</strong></p>
<p>Two updates this week relating to AWS CDK.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/aws-cdk-eks-construct-library-available-developer-preview/">AWS CDK EKS Construct Library in Developer Preview and Adds Support for cdk8s</a> The EKS Construct Library is an AWS CDK module that helps customers provision Amazon EKS clusters using infrastructure-as-code best practices. Up until now, it has been in an experimental state, incorporating lots of customer feedback and undergoing multiple API and behavioural changes. Starting from version 1.65.0, the library is graduating to Developer Preview. This means that we are not planning any breaking changes going forward and are preparing the library for GA.</p>
<p>In addition to cluster provisioning, the EKS Construct Library enables customers to deploy Kubernetes resources onto their clusters. Currently, those resources can be deployed by either manually creating Kubernetes manifests, or by installing Helm charts. Starting with version 1.67.0, customers can also utilise manifest authoring capabilities provided by The CDK for Kubernetes (cdk8s). These include type-safety, IDE assistance, and higher level constructs available via the cdk8s+ library.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/amazon-ecs-extensions-for-aws-cdk-is-now-generally-available/">Amazon ECS extensions for AWS CDK</a> The Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) extensions module that extends the service construct in AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), is now generally available. The new Amazon ECS service construct for AWS CDK supports extensions that automatically add additional capabilities such as AWS App Mesh or FireLens to your containerised services using familiar programming languages.
