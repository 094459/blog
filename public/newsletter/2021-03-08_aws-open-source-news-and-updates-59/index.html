<meta name="twitter:description" content="March 8th, 2021 - Instalment #59 Newsletter #59. This week we have a really great selection of open source projects for you to take a look at. Quail, not just a fancy egg you enjoy on those special occasions but an interesting project that helps you easily provision resources for your developers was my pick from a very good bunch. Aside from that, the usual round up of fresh blog posts from AWS and the community, some new events that are happening later this week and next and a new newsletter for you to sign up to."/>

    <h1>AWS open source news and updates #59</h1>
    <h2 id="march-8th-2021---instalment-59">March 8th, 2021 - Instalment #59</h2>
<p>Newsletter #59. This week we have a really great selection of open source projects for you to take a look at. Quail, not just a fancy egg you enjoy on those special occasions but an interesting project that helps you easily provision resources for your developers was my pick from a very good bunch. Aside from that, the usual round up of fresh blog posts from AWS and the community, some new events that are happening later this week and next and a new newsletter for you to sign up to. Speaking of which&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Observability newsletter</strong></p>
<p>Launched in the last week or so, a great new regular newsletter covering all topics on observability (abbreviated to o11y for short, which I like as I have troubles spelling it!), coming from Michael Hausenblas. From the newsletter itself he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the observability (o11y) newsletter. I&rsquo;ll be covering o11y topics including but not limited to OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, FluentBit, and other related CNCF projects. My goal is to keep you up-to-date concerning o11y topics, from blog posts to webinars to tooling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read online and sign up for the regular instalments via the link <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/99">https://o11y.news/</a></p>
<p><strong>Update on the Elasticsearch Fork</strong></p>
<p>If you have not kept up to date, the latest Fork update, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/97">Feb 26th Fork Update</a>, shows great progress is being made. One thing I would add however it to make sure you check the comments in the main <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/98">thread here</a> as there is lots of interesting information, comments as well as opportunities to contribute/share your knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="latest-from-open-source-projects">Latest from open source projects</h3>
<p>So many great projects this week, you really are spoiled for choice.</p>
<p><strong>quail</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9t">quail</a> are you looking for an open source tool that helps you to provision the compute instances you need without involving your operations staff? Well, you are in luck, as this new open source project from Qube Research may be what you need. It comes with a user interface where you can select configure EC2 instance and provision with a click of a button in any supported region or account. It manages cleaning up the resources as well - so, check out Quail. Not just a posh egg.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qube-rt/quail/master/img/screenshot.png" alt="demo"></p>
<p><strong>rpCheckup</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9u">rpCheckup</a> is an open source project from Gold Fig Labs, that is an AWS resource policy security checkup tool that identifies public, external account access, intra-org account access, and private resources. In effect, it helps you check for naughty back doors or wide open privileges by making it easier to reason about resource visibility across all the accounts in your org.</p>
<p>Check out a sample resource - don&rsquo;t worry, your resolution will improve.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/291215/109552865-2bdcdb00-7a87-11eb-95a8-977269043f1d.png" alt="report"></p>
<p><strong>actions2aws</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9v">actions2aws</a> this open source tool from Glass Echidna lets you assume AWS IAM roles from GitHub Actions workflows with no stored secrets. From the README.md:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitHub Actions are a pretty nice solution for CI/CD. Where they fall short is integration with other services, like AWS. The approach suggested by AWS is to create an IAM user, allocate it a long-lived access key and store those credentials in GitHub&rsquo;s secret storage. This is undesirable for folks working in an environment where IAM users are not permitted.
This repo is a GitHub action that can grant your workflows access to AWS via an AWS IAM role session. This means no need to store long-lived credentials in GitHub and comes with a few other benefits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hugging Face</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9i">Embracing natural language processing with Hugging Face</a> a post from my good self last week, where I sat down with a few of the folks from Hugging Face, including Co-founder Julien Chaumond, to find out more about who they were, their origins and history in open source and exactly what is Hugging Face. I left inspired by their enthusiasm and passion for making it easier for developers to build natural language processing into their apps, and if this is something you are looking to do, then definitely check out their home page.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2021/02/26/ricsue_Hugging-face_f1.png" alt="hug"></p>
<p><strong>KubeFlow</strong></p>
<p>A couple of Kubeflow related posts this week.</p>
<p>First up we have <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9p">Analyzing open-source ML pipeline models in real time using Amazon SageMaker Debugger</a> where Alex Chung, Dustin Luong, and Suraj Kota take a look at how you can use SageMaker Debugger to help model debugging in your Kubeflow Pipelines, going beyond just losses and accuracies during training to getting the full visibility into all tensors flowing through the graph during training, monitoring your training in near-real time using rules, and providing alerts if it detects an inconsistency in the training flow. All of which ultimately reduces costs and improves your company’s effectiveness on ML. Very nice post indeed.</p>
<p>Next, we have <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9n">Introducing Amazon SageMaker Reinforcement Learning Components for open-source Kubeflow pipelines</a> is a mega-collaboration between Alex Chung, Nicholas Thomson, Ragha Prasad and Sahika Genc from AWS, together with from Kyle Saltmarsh from Woodside Energy and Nicholas Therkelsen-Terry, Matthew Rose, and Leonard O’Sullivan from Max Kelsen, one of Australia’s leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions businesses. This post has lots of great stuff, including machine learning and robots, and takes a look at how you can build re-inforcement learning models with open source Kubeflow pipelines  using SageMaker RL Components. Source code, samples notebooks and everything you need to get started is shared in the post, so check it out if you want to learn more.</p>

<h3 id="case-study">Case Study</h3>
<p><strong>WordPress</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9m">Using AWS for on-premises WordPress site continuity</a> Who doesn&rsquo;t like a good Wordpress blog post? I know I do, and so it is great to see this post from Farhad Jahangirov taking a look at how Cardiff University have approached building a Wordpress architecture than spans their local environment and AWS, and how this is enabling them to eliminate the need for physical backup infrastructure and improve recovery time. This is a must read post for all Wordpress infrastructure specialists who are looking to make sure their environments remain up and running no matter what.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/9e6a55b6b4563e652a23be9d623ca5055c356940/2021/03/03/Figure-1-DR-solution-in-standby.jpg" alt="arch"></p>
<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>Ethereum</strong></p>
<p>Last week we announced the general availability of Ethereum on Amazon Managed Blockchain. Ethereum is a popular decentralised blockchain framework that establishes a peer-to-peer network allowing participants to transact without a trusted central authority. It enables popular use cases such as decentralised finance (DeFi), a network of financial applications built on top of blockchain networks. DeFi is different from existing financial networks because it is open and programmable, operates without a central authority, and enables customers to offer new methods for payments, investing, lending and trading. As customers build these Ethereum-based applications, they find it complicated and time-consuming to operate and manage their Ethereum infrastructure. Specific concerns include data reliability due to out-of-sync nodes, data storage scaling challenges, and time-sensitive Ethereum software upgrades.</p>
<p>With this launch, AWS customers can easily provision Ethereum nodes in minutes and connect to the public Ethereum main network and test networks such as Rinkeby and Ropsten. With Amazon Managed Blockchain, customers get secure networking, encryption at rest and transport, secure access to the network via standard open-source Ethereum APIs, fast and reliable syncs to the Ethereum blockchain, and durable elastic storage for ledger data. Amazon Managed Blockchain monitors node health, replaces unhealthy nodes, and automates Ethereum software upgrades, improving the availability of customers’ Ethereum infrastructure. In addition to DeFi applications, customers building analytical products such as smart contract monitoring tools and fraud detection software can also benefit from this scalable, highly available, and fully managed Ethereum service on Amazon Managed Blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>FreeRTOS</strong></p>
<p>A couple of quick updates this week for FreeRTOS users/fans.</p>
<p>First up we have news that FreeRTOS is now certified for the Security Evaluation Standard for IoT Platforms (SESIP) Assurance Level 2. With this certification, FreeRTOS libraries have demonstrated meeting a specific set of security criteria for IoT platforms. In addition, embedded developers writing FreeRTOS-based applications can achieve SESIP certification for their own applications more quickly because the underlying libraries have been tested for compliance. According to the technical standards organisation GlobalPlatform, SESIP provides a common and optimised approach for evaluating the security of connected products that meets the specific compliance, security, privacy and scalability challenges of the evolving IoT ecosystem. SESIP is based on the industry-established Common Criteria framework.</p>
<p>The certification assessment was performed by Riscure, an independent security lab licensed by TrustCB, a commercial Certification Body conforming to international and industry standards. FreeRTOS 202012.00 LTS libraries including the FreeRTOS kernel and related IoT libraries were evaluated as part of the certification process. The certification tested for verification of platform identity and instance identity, firmware updates over-the-air (OTA), secure communications, software isolation capabilities, and cryptographic operations. You can learn more in the blog: <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9c">Why SESIP Certification for FreeRTOS Matters</a>.</p>
<p>Following that we have news that FreeRTOS Long Term Support (LTS) release 202012.01 now includes the over-the-air update (OTA), AWS IoT Device Defender, and AWS IoT Jobs libraries in the first LTS release (FreeRTOS 202012.00 LTS). With this release, developers can use the FreeRTOS LTS libraries to update firmware, manage device fleets, and monitor fleet metrics for their microcontroller-based IoT devices. In addition, developers can rely on a FreeRTOS version that provides feature stability, and security patches and critical bug fixes for two years. You can read the <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/9d">full announcement here</a>, which goes into a lot of detail.</p>
<p><strong>Elasticsearch</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Elasticsearch Service now supports tag-based authorisation for easy management of access to configuration APIs that are used for operations such as creating, modifying, or updating Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains. You can create an Identity Policy in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) using Resource Tags that allows or denies access to specific configuration APIs for an Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain. You can use Request Tags or Tag Keys to control what tags can be used on a domain or passed in a request. In addition, tagging is now supported on resource creation, which means you can now add a tag when you create an Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain.</p>
