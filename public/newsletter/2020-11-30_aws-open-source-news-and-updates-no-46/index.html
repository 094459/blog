    <h1>AWS open source news and updates No. 46</h1>
    <h2 id="november-30th---instalment-46">November 30th - Instalment #46</h2>
<p>Week No.46 and this week marks the beginning of re:Invent 2020 so expect a lot of re:Invent related content in this episode and the next couple. re:Invent has not stopped the relentless march of great open source blog posts, projects and more this week, and we have some great stuff this week including&hellip;the launch of Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow, an unmissable post on Rust from Matt Asay, a bumper selection of Elasticsearch updates this week, a new project from the Amazon Neptune team and a couple of fantastic videos, one covering AWS CDK and projen and the other kube-bench.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s crack on and start with what you can expect during re:Invent.</p>
<p><strong>re:Invent 2020</strong></p>
<p>The Open Source track is back at re:Invent this year, with content spread across the first two weeks of the three-week virtual experience. This year, the Open Source track will introduce attendees to number of open source technologies such as GraphQL, Apache Kafka, Redis, Apache Flink, and more. The track will also cover topics on app acceleration using Amplify, observability with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, and chaos engineering. We have put together a couple of blog posts to help you understand in more detail what these sessions are as we know you will have a lot of hard choices to make as there are so many great sessions across all the tracks. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/reinvent-2020-open-source-track-preview/">re:Invent 2020: Open Source track preview</a> covers the open source track, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/reinvent-2020-open-source-session-round-up/">re:Invent 2020: Open source session round-up</a> takes a look beyond the open source track at other sessions where open source is featured heavily.</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s open source related sessions in chronological order are as follows. Sessions are typically repeated three times to accommodate the different time zones you might be in. These are all in CET so remember to add or subtract time depending on where you are.</p>

<h3 id="latest-from-open-source-projects">Latest from open source projects</h3>
<p><strong>graph-notebook</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook">graph-notebook</a> is a new open source tool from the Amazon Neptune team. The graph notebook provides an easy way to interact with graph databases using Jupyter notebooks. Using this open-source Python package, you can connect to any graph database that supports the Apache TinkerPop or the RDF SPARQL graph model. These databases could be running locally on your desktop or in the cloud. Graph databases can be used to explore a variety of use cases including knowledge graphs and identity graphs.</p>
<p>The open-source graph notebook provides users the flexibility to run their queries and visualisation from local desktops, EC2, or EMR in addition to using the Neptune Workbench on SageMaker. It is easily installed via the Python Package Installer (PIP). You can connect to graph databases that provide an endpoint that implements an Apache TinkerPop Gremlin Server or the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol. The notebook also gives developers the power to enhance and contribute to the features in the notebook.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook/raw/main/images/GremlinQueryGraph.png" alt="looklike"></p>
<p>Check out the coverage in Silicon Angel from Maria Deitscher, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/11/26/aws-open-sources-graph-notebook-make-working-graph-databases-easier/">AWS open sources Graph Notebook to make working with graph databases easier</a>.</p>
<p><strong>geneve-proxy</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sentialabs/geneve-proxy">geneve-proxy</a> is an open source reference application for a proxy appliance behind an AWS Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) from <a href="https://github.com/sentialabs">Sentia Labs</a>. They put together a blog post to help you understand what and why this project was put together. <a href="https://www.sentiatechblog.com/geneveproxy-an-aws-gateway-load-balancer-reference-application">GeneveProxy - an AWS Gateway Load Balancer reference application</a> walks you through what was built - a first party application, written in Python, which receives traffic from the GWLB, decapsulates the packet, inspects the packet, re-encapsulates it and returns it to the GWLB. Warning, contains ascii tables (which I love!)</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/9gzi1io5uqx8/6iysA8pOA9MnruSIYjHNXN/59f0c728a130fa204804eb8854a3f595/overview.png?fit=scale&amp;w=920" alt="arch"></p>
<p><strong>aws-app-mesh-examples</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-app-mesh-examples/tree/master/walkthroughs/howto-k8s-mtls-sds-based">aws-app-mesh-examples</a> this is an open source solution to help you understand how to enable mTLS between two applications in App Mesh using Envoy&rsquo;s Secret Discovery Service(SDS). SDS allows envoy to fetch certificates from a remote SDS Server. When SDS is enabled and configured in Envoy, it will fetch the certificates from a central SDS server. SDS server will automatically renew the certs when they are about to expire and will push them to respective envoys. This greatly simplifies the certificate management process for individual services/apps and is more secure when compared to file based certs as the certs are no longer stored on the disk. If the envoy fails to fetch a certificate from the SDS server for any reason, the listener will be marked as active and the port will be open but the connection to the port will be reset.</p>
<p><strong>awsicons</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/boyney123/awsicons">awsicons</a> is an open source set of high-quality SVG icons for you to use in your web projects that has been forked from another project (documented in the README) by David Boyne. David has also put together this website <a href="https://awsicons.dev">https://awsicons.dev</a> which is a great way to quickly find the icons you need (and in fact, was very helpful as I was looking for an icon for AWS Nitro Enclave and it was in this collection!)</p>
<p><strong>s3_objects_check</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nccgroup/s3_objects_check">s3_objects_check</a> in an open source tool from the <a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/">NCC Group</a> that provides a white-box evaluation of effective S3 object permissions, in order to identify publicly accessible objects. It allows identifying publicly accessible objects, as well as objects accessible for AuthenticatedUsers (by using a secondary profile). A number of tools exist which check permissions on buckets, but due to the complexity of IAM resource policies and ACL combinations, the effective permissions on specific objects is often hard to assess. The tool runs fast as it uses asyncio and aiobotocore. Easy to run via the command line, with some examples to get you started.</p>
<h3 id="aws-open-source-posts">AWS open source posts</h3>
<p><strong>Rust</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/why-aws-loves-rust-and-how-wed-like-to-help/">Why AWS loves Rust, and how we’d like to help</a> this post from Matt Asay where he shares the where (and why) of how AWS uses Rust, and talks a little of our contributions and their evolution. The stand out piece from this post is the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s be clear: We understand that we are net beneficiaries of the exceptional work that others have done to make Rust thrive. AWS didn’t start Rust or make it the success that it is today, but we’d like to contribute to its future success. We are convinced that investing in the wider Rust ecosystem helps our customers and those who may never become our customers. That’s OK. That’s how open source is supposed to work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you read the rest though, including some great quotes from other AWS builders and what they are doing with Rust.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch agent</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/getting-started-with-open-source-amazon-cloudwatch-agent/">Getting started with open source Amazon CloudWatch Agent</a> Kevin Wagner talks about the recently open sourced <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Install-CloudWatch-Agent.html">Amazon CloudWatch Agent</a> and how this has allowed community contributions, enabled customisation for client-specific use cases, and provided greater level of trust and security through design and implementation transparency. Kevin provides a brief overview of use cases for CloudWatch Agent and walks through how to install and begin configuring the agent.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-mwaa/">Introducing Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)</a> Danilo Poccia announces the availability of Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA), a fully managed service that makes it easy to run open-source versions of Apache Airflow on AWS and to build workflows to execute your extract-transform-load (ETL) jobs and data pipelines. Developers and data engineers simplify the overall process of building those ETL jobs by decomposing it into a series of smaller tasks and coordinate the execution of these tasks as part of a workflow. Apache Airflow is a popular open source platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. With Airflow you can manage workflows as scripts, monitor them via the user interface (UI), and extend their functionality through a set of powerful plugins. Danilo provides a good introduction and walkthrough so you can build your first workflow.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2020/11/17/mwaa-graph-view-1024x466.png" alt="dag"></p>
<p>As Danilo notes, upstream compatibility is a core tenet of Amazon MWAA. Our code changes to the AirFlow platform are released back to open source.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Hive</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/accessing-and-visualizing-external-tables-in-an-apache-hive-metastore-with-amazon-athena-and-amazon-quicksight/">Accessing and visualizing external tables in an Apache Hive metastore with Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight</a> this is a blog post and solution from James Sun, Gagan Brahmi, and Chinmayi Narasimhadevara walk you through a solution that uses Athena to query external Apache Hive tables with public COVID-19 datasets. This posts shows you how to configure a remote Hive metastore based on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and MySQL with Amazon EMR, and then demonstrates how you can use a Spark step to pull COVID-19 datasets from a public repository and transform the data into a performant Parquet columnar storage format.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Flink</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/realtime-in-stream-inference-kinesis-sagemaker-flink/">Real-Time In-Stream Inference with AWS Kinesis, SageMaker &amp; Apache Flink</a> in this collaboration between Shawn Sachdev, Daniel Pinheiro, Johny Duval, and Rohit Yadav you will learn how you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache Flink (KDA), Apache Flink as well as some other AWS services to address the challenges such as real-time fraud detection on a stream of credit card transaction data. They explore how to build a managed, reliable, scalable, and highly available streaming architecture based on managed services that substantially reduce the operational overhead compared to a self-managed environment, and focus on how to prepare and run Flink applications with KDA for Apache Flink applications.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fc074d501302eb2b93e2554793fcaf50b3bf7291/2020/11/23/Run-Apache-Flink-applications-with-KDA-for-Apache-Flink-applications-1024x408.png" alt="arch"></p>
<p><strong>Telegraf</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/collecting-storing-and-analyzing-your-devops-workloads-with-open-source-telegraf-amazon-timestream-and-grafana/">Collecting, storing, and analyzing your DevOps workloads with open-source Telegraf, Amazon Timestream, and Grafana</a> Piotr Westfalewicz writes on Telegraf, an open-source, plugin-driven server agent for collecting and reporting metrics and how to integrate Telegraf with Amazon Timestream, a serverless time series database service for IoT and operational applications. With the Timestream output plugin for Telegraf, you can now ingest metrics from Telegraf agent directly to Timestream and then use Grafana to visualise the metrics stored.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2020/11/05/Pic1.png" alt="arch"></p>
<p><strong>Elasticsearch</strong></p>
<p>A bumper selection of new features and improvements this week covering Elasticsearch. The team and community has been super busy it would appear, awesome stuff.</p>
<p>First up we have a general update on the Amazon Elasticsearch Service that now supports open source Elasticsearch 7.9 and its corresponding version of Kibana. This minor release includes bug fixes and enhancements. In this new release, Elasticsearch added support for concurrent snapshot operations. You can now create manual snapshots while automatic snapshots are in progress. Also, you can delete multiple snapshots in a single snapshot delete call. With Elasticsearch 7.9, the default for WRITE thread pool size is changed to 10000. This change lets a single domain support indexing requests from a large number of simultaneous clients. This release also includes support for recently released features like detailed audit logging of all Elasticsearch requests, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to offer single sign-on (SSO) for Kibana, and custom domain names. All these features are components of Open Distro for Elasticsearch, an Apache 2.0-licensed distribution of Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>Next up is news that Amazon Elasticsearch Service also introduced several security enhancements to the fine-grained access control feature.  These include a revamped and improved security workflow in Kibana, and integration with Open Distro for Elasticsearch Alerting and Anomaly Detection features. The integration with Alerting and Anomaly Detection extends fine-grained access control to allow users with limited permissions to create and manage alerts and monitors. Previously, users needed administrator privileges for these tasks, but with this release, you can control how your users leverage these features. The revamped Kibana security user interface simplifies the assignment and management of fine-grained access control user permissions and role mappings while improving readability. All your existing permissions and mappings will be automatically presented in the new format. These enhancements are available on any Amazon Elasticsearch Service domain version 7.9 with fine-grained access control enabled.</p>
<p>If that was not enough, Amazon Elasticsearch Service also now supports Gantt charts, a new visualisation in Kibana. Users can now embed Gantt charts into dashboards to enable visualisation of events, steps and tasks as horizontal bars. The length of the bars shows the amount of time associated with an event, step or a task. Gantt charts are used to represent a series of events that contain a parent-child relationship. This can be particularly useful in trace analytics, telemetry, and monitoring use cases, in which the users need to understand the overall interaction between traces or events. Gantt charts help users manage their resources by getting an overview of the events or tasks and understanding the relationships between them. Gantt chart in Kibana is powered by Open Distro for Elasticsearch, an Apache 2.0-licensed distribution of Elasticsearch. Kibana Reports is supported on all Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains running Elasticsearch 7.9 or greater. To learn more about Open Distro for Elasticsearch and Gantt charts, visit the project website and documentation.</p>
<p>Following that we have this blog post from Kaituo Li and Chris Swierczewski, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/a-deep-dive-into-high-cardinality-anomaly-detection-in-elasticsearch/">A deep dive into high-cardinality anomaly detection in Elasticsearch</a>. This post takes a look into the motivation, design, and development of the high-cardinality anomaly detection (HCAD) capability within Elasticsearch, beginning with an in-depth description of the HCAD problem and its properties and then looking at the details of this solution. They follow exploring the challenges and questions we encountered during the research and development and conclude by describing the system and architecture of this solution.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2020/11/20/detection-in-Elasticsearch-3.jpg" alt="arch"></p>
<p>And yet more! Amazon Elasticsearch Service now offers support for Remote Reindex, enabling you to migrate data from a remote cluster into Amazon Elasticsearch Service. With this feature, you can simply copy data from one cluster to another, making it easier to migrate from legacy versions of Elasticsearch. Remote Reindex also supports migrating indexes from self-managed Elasticsearch onto Amazon Elasticsearch Service, providing a simple mechanism to onboard onto the service. You can read more about this <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/elasticsearch-service-announces-support-for-remote-reindex/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We are not quite finished yet, as we also had this update from the Amazon Elasticsearch team. It now supports Piped Processing Language (PPL), a new feature that enables users to explore, discover and find data stored in Amazon ES, using a set of commands delimited by pipes (|). PPL extends Elasticsearch to support a standard set of commands that is easy for system developers, DevOps engineers, support engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers who are proficient with Linux or Unix to learn. PPL enables these users to begin extracting insights from their log, monitoring and observability data on day one. Read more <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/amazon-elasticsearch-service-introduces-piped-processing-language-ppl/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a video from Ekene Amaechi who takes a look at visualisation in Open Distro for Elasticsearch using a sample set of financial data. There are two videos, this is part one so make sure you check the second.</p>

<p><strong>AWS Copilot</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/aws-copilot-is-now-generally-available/">AWS Copilot is now generally available</a> Nathan Peck announces the general availability of AWS Copilot, an open source command line interface that makes it easy for developers to build, release, and operate production ready containerized applications on Amazon ECS and AWS Fargate. This means the initial development and breaking changes are done and Copilot is ready for you to use in production. Lots of resources to get you started with Copilot, including blog posts and video walk throughs.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2020/11/23/screen.png" alt="copilot"></p>
<p><strong>AWS App Mesh</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/appmesh-integrating-cross-vpc-ecs-cluster-for-enhanced-security/">Integrating cross VPC ECS cluster for enhanced security with AWS App Mesh</a> Vikram Venkataraman writes about how you can use App Mesh for connecting, securing, and observing your cross-compute, cross-cluster, and cross-VPC workloads. AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy. It standardises how applications communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility, and helping to ensure high-availability for your applications. A service mesh is composed of two parts, a control plane and a data plane. AWS App Mesh has a managed control plane so you as a user don’t need to install or manage any servers to run it. The data plane for App Mesh is the open source Envoy proxy. It is your responsibility to add the Envoy proxy as a side car to each application you want to expose and manage via App Mesh.</p>
<p><img src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2020/11/23/AppMesh-TLS.png" alt="arch"></p>
<p><strong>Fluent bit</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/persistent-storage-for-container-logging-using-fluent-bit-and-amazon-efs/">Persistent storage for container logging using Fluent Bit and Amazon EFS</a> Shrinath Kurdekar shows you how to persist logs from your Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) containers on highly durable, highly available, elastic, and POSIX-compliant Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems using Fluent Bit. Fluent Bit is an open source log shipper and processor, that can collect data from multiple sources and forward it to different destinations for further analysis. Fluent Bit is a lightweight and performant log shipper and forwarder that is a successor to Fluentd and is a part of the Fluentd Ecosystem.</p>

<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/new-key-unlocking-drug-discovery/">A new key to unlocking drug discovery</a> Angela Wu takes a look at VirtualFlow, a new open-source software that is helping to narrow down and identify from the trillions of potential chemical compounds, which ones are best suited to help tackle a specific disease. Infectious disease specialists work to find the specific compound (key) that can bind to the right spot (lock) on a disease-enabling proteins to block its activity but the the key question they ask themselves is: which of the small molecule among the trillion is the right one for a specific disease? Given the range of possible molecule to protein combinations, finding the right small molecule that is able to bind strongly to a certain target site and inhibit its function is a time-intensive and challenging and this post explores how this new open source project, VirtualFlow is helping. Read on to find out more.</p>

<p><strong>PostgresSQL</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://dev.to/aws-heroes/postgresql-in-aws-clearing-the-doubts-44ep">PostgreSQL in AWS: clearing the doubts</a> this post from AWS Data Hero Franck Pachot looks to clarify any doubts as to the nature of PostgresSQL on AWS, taking a look at some of the options you have, some of the features and what you need to look out for when rolling your own vs using managed services.</p>
<p><strong>Delta Lake</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/seek-blog/data-lakehousing-in-aws-7c76577ed88f">Data Lakehousing in AWS</a> George Pongracz who is a senior Data Engineer in the Enterprise DataOps Team at SEEK shares how they built a Data Lakehouse on AWS. After lifting and shifting their data warehouse to Amazon Redshift and ETL to Amazon EMR/PySpark, they took an opportunity to rethink and optimise their data platform as part of their CRM re-platform project. This combined Amazon Redshift and Delta Lake by creating a PySpark NoLoader program in conjunction with AWS services and a move from manual to automated processes, including the use of Apache Airflow for orchestration. For those perhaps unfamiliar with Delta Lake, it is an &ldquo;open source columnar storage layer based on the Parquet file format. It provides ACID transactions and simplifies and facilitates the development of incremental data pipelines over cloud object stores like Amazon S3, beyond what is offered by Parquet whilst also providing schema evolution of tables.&rdquo;</p>
