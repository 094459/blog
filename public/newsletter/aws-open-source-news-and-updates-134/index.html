<p><strong>sandbox-accounts-for-events</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27q">sandbox-accounts-for-events</a> &ldquo;Sandbox Accounts for Events&rdquo; allows to provide multiple, temporary AWS accounts to a number of authenticated users simultaneously via a browser-based GUI. It uses the concept of &ldquo;leases&rdquo; to create temporary access tickets and allows to define expiration periods as well as maximum budget spend per leased AWS account. Check out the docs for some example uses cases where you might find a tool like this useful, as well as understanding more how this works under the hood.</p>

<p><strong>frontend-discovery</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27r">frontend-discovery</a> The aim of this project is to define and drive adoption of a frontend discovery pattern, with a primary focus on client-side rendered (CSR), server-side rendered (SSR) and edge-side rendered (ESR) micro-frontends. The frontend discovery pattern improves the development experience when developing, testing, and delivering micro-frontends by making use of a shareable configuration describing the entry point of micro-frontends, as well as additional metadata that can be used to deploy in every environment safely.</p>

<h3 id="quick-updates">Quick updates</h3>
<p><strong>PHP</strong></p>
<p>AWS App Runner now supports PHP 8.1, Go 1.18, .Net 6, and Ruby 3.1 managed runtimes for building and running web applications and APIs. These runtimes enable you to leverage the App Runner “build from source” capability to build and deploy directly from your source code repository without needing to learn the internals of building and managing your own container images.</p>
<p>Starting today, you can build and run your services based on PHP 8.1, Go 1.18, .Net 6, and Ruby 3.1 directly from your source code on App Runner. All these new managed runtimes in App Runner are active long-term support (LTS) major versions.</p>
<p><strong>Apache Kafka</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) now offers Tiered storage that brings a virtually unlimited and low-cost storage tier. Tiered Storage lets you store and process data using the same Kafka APIs and clients , while saving your storage costs by 50% or more over existing MSK storage options . Tiered Storage makes it easy and cost-effective when you need a longer safety buffer to handle unexpected processing delays or build new stream processing applications. You can now scale your compute and storage independently, simplifying operations.</p>
<p>Amazon MSK Connect also now supports Private DNS hostnames for enhanced security. With Private DNS hostname support in MSK Connect, you can configure connectors to reference public or private domain names. Connectors will use the DNS servers configured in your VPC’s DHCP option set to resolve domain names. You can now use MSK Connect to privately connect with databases, data warehouses and other resources in your VPC to comply with your security needs.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon EMR</strong></p>
<p>Amazon EMR 6.8 has seen a number of updates that you should be aware of.</p>
<p><em>PrestoDB and Trino</em></p>
<p>With PrestoDB and Trino on EMR 6.8, users benefit from a configuration setting, called the strict mode that prevents cost overruns due to long running queries.Customers have told us that poorly written SQL queries can sometimes run for long times, and consume resources from other business critical workloads. To help administrators take action on such queries, we are introducing strict mode setting that allows warning or rejecting certain types of queries. Examples include queries without predicates on partitioned columns that result in large table scans, or queries that involve cross join between large tables, and/or queries that sort large number of rows without limit. You can set up strict mode configuration during cluster creation and also override the setting using session properties. You can apply strict mode checks for select, insert, create table as select and explain analyse query types.</p>
<p>We are also excited to announce that Amazon EMR PrestoDB and Trino has added a new features to handle spot interruptions that helps run your queries cost effectively and reliably. Spot Instances in Amazon EMR allows you to run big data workloads on spare Amazon EC2 capacity at a reduced cost compared to On-Demand instances. However, Amazon EC2 can interrupt spot instances with a two-minute notification. PrestoDB/Trino queries fail when spot nodes are terminated. This has meant that customers were unable to run such workloads on spot instances and take advantage of lower costs. In EMR 6.7, we added a new capability to PrestoDB/Trino engine to detect spot interruptions and determine if the existing queries can complete within two minutes on those nodes. If the queries cannot finish, we fail quickly and retry the queries on different nodes. Amazon EMR PrestoDB/Trino engine also does not schedule new queries on spot nodes that are about to be reclaimed. With these two new features, you will get best of both worlds - improved resiliency with PrestoDB/Trino engine on Amazon EMR, and running queries economically on spot nodes.</p>
<p><em>Hive</em></p>
<p>Hive users run Metastore check command with the repair table option (MSCK REPAIR table) to update the partition metadata in the Hive metastore for partitions that were directly added to or removed from the file system (S3 or HDFS). When run, MSCK repair command must make a file system call to check if the partition exists for each partition. This step could take a long time if the table has thousands of partitions. In EMR 6.5, we introduced an optimisation to MSCK repair command in Hive to reduce the number of S3 file system calls when fetching partitions . This feature improves performance of MSCK command (~15-20x on 10k+ partitions) due to reduced number of file system calls especially when working on tables with large number of partitions. Previously, you had to enable this feature by explicitly setting a flag. Starting with Amazon EMR 6.8, we further reduced the number of S3 filesystem calls to make MSCK repair run faster and enabled this feature by default.</p>
<p>In addition to MSCK repair table optimisation, we also like to share that Amazon EMR Hive users can now use Parquet modular encryption to encrypt and authenticate sensitive information in Parquet files. It is a challenging task to protect the privacy and integrity of sensitive data at scale while keeping the Parquet functionality intact. Data protection solutions such as encrypting files or storage layer are currently used to encrypt Parquet files, however, they could lead to performance degradation. With Parquet modular encryption, you can not only enable granular access control but also preserve the Parquet optimisations such as columnar projection, predicate pushdown, encoding and compression. Using Parquet modular encryption, Amazon EMR Hive users can protect both Parquet data and metadata, use different encryption keys for different columns, and perform partial encryption of only sensitive columns. It also allows clients to check integrity of the data retrieved while keeping all Parquet optimisations.</p>
<p><em>Apache Flink</em></p>
<p>Amazon EMR includes Apache Flink 1.15.1. This feature is available on EMR on EC2.
Apache Flink is an open source framework and engine for processing data streams. Apache Flink 1.15.1 on EMR 6.8 includes 62 bug fixes, vulnerability fixes, and minor improvements over Flink 1.15.0. Key features include:</p>
<p>Watermark alignment (Beta) across data sources : Event-time processing in Flink depends on special timestamped elements, called watermarks, that are inserted into the stream either by the data sources or by a watermark generator. A watermark with a timestamp t can be understood as an assertion that all events with timestamps &lt; t have already arrived. Watermark alignment is useful when processing sources with different velocity of events e.g. when one source is idle or one source emits records relatively faster than others, you can enable watermark alignment for each source separately. Flink aligns watermarks by pausing the highest velocity source and continuing to read records from other sources until the watermarks are aligned.
SQL version upgrade : Introducing JSON plans which are JSON functions that make it easier to import and export structured data in SQL. Today, version upgrades can alter the topology of SQL queries which can introduce snapshot incompatibility across versions. This makes upgrading Flink versions challenging. With this feature, both the Table API and SQL will provide a way to compile and execute a plan ensuring the same topology for SQL queries throughout different versions, making it more reliable to upgrade to future versions. Users who want to give it a try can create a JSON plan that can then be used to restore a Flink job based on the old operator structure.</p>
<p><em>Apache Hudi and Apache Iceberg</em></p>
<p>Amazon EMR release 6.8 now supports Apache Hudi 0.11.1 and Apache Iceberg 0.14.0. You can use these frameworks on Amazon EMR on EC2, and Amazon EMR on EKS as well as on Amazon EMR Serverless.</p>
<p>Apache Hudi 0.11.1 on Amazon EMR 6.8 includes support for Spark 3.3.0, adds Multi-Modal Index support and Data Skipping with Metadata Table that allows adding bloom filter and column stats indexes to tables which can significantly improve query performance, adds an Async Indexer service which allows users to create different kinds of indices (e.g., files, bloom filters, and column stats) in the metadata table without blocking ingestion, includes Spark SQL improvements adding support for update or delete records in Hudi tables using non-primary-key fields and Time travel query via timestamp as of syntax, includes Flink integration improvements with support for both Flink 1.13.x and 1.14.x and support for complex data types such as Map and Array etc. In addition, Hudi 0.11.1 includes bug fixes over Hudi 0.11.0 available in Amazon EMR release 6.7.</p>
<p>Apache Iceberg 0.14.0 on Amazon EMR 6.8 includes support for Spark 3.3.0, adds Merge-on-read support for MERGE and UPDATE statements, adds support to rewrite partitions using Z-order that allows to re-organize partitions to be efficient with query predicates on multiple columns and also to keep similar data together, includes several performance improvements for scan planning in Spark queries, add support for row group skipping using Parquet bloom filters, etc.</p>
<p><strong>AWS ParallelCluster</strong></p>
<p>AWS ParallelCluster 3.3 is now generally available and introduces a new feature for compute resource optimisation. With this new feature, you can map a compute resource to a list of Amazon EC2 instance types with an allocation strategy to optimize compute capacity for your HPC jobs. Other features include updates that support dynamically mounting shared storage, Slurm accounting, and Amazon EC2 on demand capacity reservations (ODCR).</p>
<p>Check out the announcement for more details, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27h">AWS ParallelCluster 3.3: multiple instance type allocation and other top requested features</a></p>
<p>Matt Vaughn has also published a blog post, <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/27i">Support for Instance Allocation Flexibility in AWS ParallelCluster 3.3</a>, where he explains in detail how a new feature that was also announced called “multiple instance type allocation” in ParallelCluster 3.3.0. This feature enables you to specify multiple instance types to use when scaling up the compute resources for a Slurm job queue. Your HPC workloads will have more paths forward to get access to the EC2 capacity they need, helping you to get more computing done.</p>

<p>re:Invent is only a few weeks away so I want to share a few things that will hopefully be of interest.</p>
<p>First up, we will be running the Build On Live stream throughout re:Invent and we would love to feature you! If either yourself, or perhaps you know a community member going to re:Invent and think they will absolutely love to attend the livestream, we want to hear from you. Please nominate a community member you want to hear from during Build On Live <a href="https://eventbox.dev/survey/6B0ED1J">using this survey</a>.</p>
<p>Second, check out this handy way to look at all the amazing open source sessions, then check out this <a href="https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/252">dashboard</a> [sign up required]. I would love to hear which ones you are excited about so please let me know in the comments or via Twitter. If you want to hear what my top three, must watch sessions, then this is what I would attend (sadly, as an AWS employee I am not allowed to attend sessions)</p>
<ol>
<li>OPN306 AWS Lambda Powertools: Lessons from the road to 10 million downloads - Heitor Lessa is going to deliver an amazing session on the journey from idea to one of the most loved and used open source tools for AWS Lambda users</li>
<li>BOA204 When security, safety, and urgency all matter: Handling Log4Shell - Cannot wait for this session from Abbey Fuller who will walk us through how we managed this incident</li>
<li>OPN202 Maintaining the AWS Amplify Framework in the open - Matt Auerbach and Ashish Nanda are going to share details on how Amplify engineering managers work with the OSS community to build open-source software</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other great open source sessions, and hopefully I will try and put together a more comprehensive list as approach re:Invent.</p>
<p><strong>OpenSearch</strong>
<strong>Every other Tuesday, 3pm GMT</strong></p>
<p>This regular meet-up is for anyone interested in OpenSearch &amp; Open Distro. All skill levels are welcome and they cover and welcome talks on topics including: search, logging, log analytics, and data visualisation.</p>
