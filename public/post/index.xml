      <description>Adding a new assistant in Ragna Following up from my previous post on Ragna, I wanted to share following the announcement of Meta&amp;rsquo;s Llama2 13b model availability within Amazon Bedrock, how you can incorporate that.&#xA;I have also put together a GitHub repo that shares the code, something that I got quite a few questions from the original post.&#xA;Adding Meta&amp;rsquo;s Llama2&#xA;As with adding Amazon Bedrock&amp;rsquo;s Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude support, it was pretty straight forward to modify the original code to add support for Llama2.</description>

      <description>Unboxing Ragna: Getting hands on and making it to work with Amazon Bedrock I am always on the look out for interesting new projects to check out, and this week I came across Ragna, an open source Retrieval Augmented Generation RAG orchestration framework. It is a new project with a committed and active community, so I wanted to find out more about this project.&#xA;What piqued my interest was reading this blog post, Unveiling Ragna: An Open Source RAG-based AI Orchestration Framework Designed to Scale From Research to Production which takes a look at the background, or as I like to think of it, the &amp;ldquo;scratch that needed to be itched&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Getting started with Griptape Getting gnarly with AI&#xA;When I was much much younger, I was known to (very occasionally) drop an ollie, kick-turn, or very occasionally dare a drop in on my trusty skateboard. Thanks to the grip tape, my shoes would stick to the board, and gave me the confidence I could try these tricks. I was always grateful to that grip tape and who knew all these years later, I would become re-aquatinted with it (albeit in a different form!</description>

      <description>How are you using these new AI coding assistants like Amazon CodeWhisperer? I want to share a quick story about how I am finding some success with using these tools, which I hope will encourage you to experiment for yourselves.&#xA;As I work on new projects, demos, blog posts, I often need to do supporting activities such as creating or cleaning up AWS environments, which I sometimes do by hand but mostly do via the AWS CLI or via Python scripts and boto3.</description>

      <description>I have written in the past about setting up developer environments and tools when working with Apache Airflow. Today I came across a new tool from Kaxil Naik, directory of engineering at Astronomer and all round Apache Airflow good guy. Kaxil has put together airflowctl, a command-line tool for managing Apache Airflowâ„¢ projects, and making it super easy to get up and running. What does it do? Well, it helps you install and use different versions of Apache Airflow, work with Variables and Connections, provide live logs, and more.</description>

      <description>Update, August 1st&#xA;I have been running this project for five weeks now, so have a better understanding of costs. My bill in July was $0.85, and I suspect this will be reasonably stable over the coming months. I think this represents great value! I will report back at the end of the year and update this&#xA;Like many folk, I run a personal blog. This blog runs Hugo and turns my markdown pages into static content, which I then deploy on Netlify.</description>

      <description>CIFS (Common Internet File System) and SMB (Server Message Block) are both Windows file-sharing protocols used in storage systems. As part of a new demo/blog post that looks at how to use data stored on SMB/CIF file shares with Apache Airflow, I have been exploring the various options of creating SMB/CIF compatible resources.

      <description>Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) recently launched a new feature that a lot of folk had been asking for, which was the ability to add additional libraries, binaries, or environment variables when launching Airflow workers. If you missed the announcement, Amazon MWAA now supports Shell Launch Scripts, this new capability allows you to easily do this by creating a script and then configuring your MWAA environments to use that script during the start-up phase.</description>

      <description>Here is a quick recipe if you are looking to get mwaa-local-runner up and running on your Cloud9 developer setup. This might not be the most optimised way, so I am very happy to received suggestions on how to improve this. What I will cover here is how to deploy mwaa-local-runner onto a standard Cloud9 IDE, deployed in a default VPC.&#xA;Updating my AWS Cloud9 environment&#xA;The first thing I needed to do was to increase the size of my local disk as Cloud9 only provides 10gb of storage.</description>

      <description>I have written in the past about how you can get started with Apache Airflow using the AWS managed service, Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow. But what if you want to self managed Apache Airflow? When I speak with developers, there are sometimes reasons why a managed service might not fit their needs. Some of the common things that come up include:&#xA;whether you need the increase level of access, a greater level of control of the configuration of Apache Airflow have the need to have the very latest versions or features of Apache Airflow if you have the need to run workflows that use more resources that managed services provide (for example, need significant compute) Total Cost Ownership One thing to consider when assessing managed vs self managed is the cost of the managed service against the total costs of you having to do the same thing.</description>

      <description>VSCode and Apache Airflow In this short post, I wanted to highlight how you can use a VSCode plugin to work with a local running instance of Apache Airflow to improve the developer experience. This post was inspired by a tweet from Kaxil Naik who was asking about what features developers are looking for when using VSCode and Pycharm and Apache Airflow.&#xA;In this post I will show you how you can configure mwaa-local-runner, an open source project that provides you with an easy way to get a local Apache Airflow environment up and running (that is configuration wide, aligned to the Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow service MWAA), together with some VSCode plugins.</description>

      <description>When putting together a previous post on how to use open source tools to create a software bill of materials (SBOM), Ritesh Noronha alerted me to another project, sbomqs that aims to simplify the evaluation of SBOM quality for both producers and consumers. A quality SBOM is one that is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. It should accurately reflect the components and dependencies used in the software application, including their version and optionally any known vulnerabilities.</description>

      <description>Configuring the KubernetesPodOperator on Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) - non OIDC Amazon EKS Clusters Today I came across an interesting question around the use of the KubernetesPodOperator working on EKS Clusters where you have not configured OIDC.

I have also put together a repo for this here&#xA;I thought that I would also check/update that it works for newer versions of MWAA, so I had 2.</description>

      <description>Maximising the re-use of your DAGs in MWAA&#xA;During some recently conversations with customers, one of the topics that they were interested in was how to create re-usable, parameterised Apache Airflow workflows (DAGs) that could be executed dynamically through the use variables and/or parameters (either submitted via the UI or the command line). This makes a lot of sense, as you may find that you repeat similar tasks in your workflows, and so this approach allows you to maximise the re-use of that work.</description>

While most applications can be easily migrated to the cloud, some applications need to remain on-premises due to low-latency or data sovereignty requirements.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Apache Airflow slack channel is a vibrant community of open source builders that is a great source of feedback, knowledge and answers to problems and use cases you might have when trying to do stuff with Apache Airflow. This week I picked up on someone seeing errors with Amazon EKS, and so I thought what better time to try out the new Apache Airflow 2.x version that was recently launched in Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA).</description>

      <description>Introduction Inspired by a recent conversation within the Apache Airflow open source slack community, I decided to channel the inner terrier within me to tackle this particular issue, around getting an Apache Airflow operator (the protagonist for this post) to work.&#xA;I found the perfect catalyst in the way of the original launch post of Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). As is often the way, diving into that post (creating a workflow to take some source files, transform them and then move them into Amazon Redshift) led me down some unexpected paths to here, this post.</description>

Amazon Athena and Amazon EMR are two AWS services that help customers who have existing SQL skills/expertise and are looking at tools such as Presto or Apache Hive when undertaking those transformations.</description>

Setting this up was super easy, and very quickly I had my domain pointing to the alias and serving requests.&#xA;As part of the setup, I wanted to monitor the application load balancer to let me know when requests were failing to the downstream application (anything other than an HTTP 200) and so I set this up super easily in Amazon Cloudwatch.</description>

From studies such as the State of Enterprise Open Source by Red Hat (in which nearly 70% of respondents stated that open source software is either extremely or very important) or TideLiftâ€™s April 2019 survey report (that found more than 90% of professional developers use open source in building their applications) it is clear that developers from startups to highly regulated enterprises have embraced open source solutions.</description>
