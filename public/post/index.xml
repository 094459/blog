      <description>Introduction In a previous post, I shared how you can using AWS CDK to provision your Apache Airflow environments using the Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow service (MWAA).
I was contacted this week by Michael Grabenstein, who flagged an issue with the code in that post. The post used code that configured a kms key for the MWAA environment, but when trying to deploy the app it would fail with the following error:</description>

      <description>Integrating with Amazon Timestream in your Apache Airflow DAGs
Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, and serverless time series database service perfect for use cases that generate huge amounts of events per day, optimised to make it faster and more cost effective that using relational databases.
I have been playing around with Amazon Timestream to prepare for a talk I am doing with some colleagues, and wanted to see how I could integrate it with other AWS services in the context of leveraging some of the key capabilities of Amazon Timestream.</description>

      <description>Reading and writing data across different AWS accounts in you Apache Airflow DAGs
As regular readers will know, I sometimes lurk in the Apache Airflow slack channel to see what is going on. If you are new to Apache Airflow, or want to get a deeper understanding then I highly recommend spending some time here. The community is super welcoming and eager to help new participants.
It was during a recent session I came across an interesting problem that one of the builders was having, which was how to access (read/write) data in an S3 bucket which was in a different account to the one hosting Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA).</description>

      <description>Maximising the re-use of your DAGs in MWAA
During some recently conversations with customers, one of the topics that they were interested in was how to create re-usable, parameterised Apache Airflow workflows (DAGs) that could be executed dynamically through the use variables and/or parameters (either submitted via the UI or the command line). This makes a lot of sense, as you may find that you repeat similar tasks in your workflows, and so this approach allows you to maximise the re-use of that work.</description>

Organisations are moving their workloads to the cloud as quickly as they can. While most applications can be easily migrated to the cloud, some applications need to remain on-premises due to low-latency or data sovereignty requirements.</description>

      <description>Introduction The Apache Airflow slack channel is a vibrant community of open source builders that is a great source of feedback, knowledge and answers to problems and use cases you might have when trying to do stuff with Apache Airflow. This week I picked up on someone seeing errors with Amazon EKS, and so I thought what better time to try out the new Apache Airflow 2.x version that was recently launched in Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA).</description>

      <description>Introduction Inspired by a recent conversation within the Apache Airflow open source slack community, I decided to channel the inner terrier within me to tackle this particular issue, around getting an Apache Airflow operator (the protagonist for this post) to work.
I found the perfect catalyst in the way of the original launch post of Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). As is often the way, diving into that post (creating a workflow to take some source files, transform them and then move them into Amazon Redshift) led me down some unexpected paths to here, this post.</description>

      <description>update I am grateful to Michael Grabenstein for spotting some mistakes in the original post/code. I hope these have now been rectified in this post.
 Using AWS CDK to deploy your Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow environment What better way to celebrate CDK Day than to return to a previous blog where I wrote about automating the installation and configuration of Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA), and take a look at doing the same thing but this time using AWS CDK.</description>

      <description>update: I have changed the post to use standard Apache Airflow variables rather than using AWS Secrets Manager.
Part One - Automating Amazon Athena As part of an upcoming DevDay event, I have been working on how you can use Apache Airflow to help automate your Extract, Load and Transform (ELT) Workflows. Amazon Athena and Amazon EMR are two AWS services that help customers who have existing SQL skills/expertise and are looking at tools such as Presto or Apache Hive when undertaking those transformations.</description>

      <description>Part Two - Automating Amazon EMR In Part One, we automated an example ELT workflow on Amazon Athena using Apache Airflow. In this post, Part Two, we will do the same thing but automate the same example ELT workflow using Amazon EMR.
Make sure you recap the setup from Part One. All the code so you can reproduce this yourself can be found in the GitHub repository here.

      <description>Today I was setting up an application load balancer that sits in front of a test application I have put together. Setting this up was super easy, and very quickly I had my domain pointing to the alias and serving requests.
As part of the setup, I wanted to monitor the application load balancer to let me know when requests were failing to the downstream application (anything other than an HTTP 200) and so I set this up super easily in Amazon Cloudwatch.</description>

From studies such as the State of Enterprise Open Source by Red Hat (in which nearly 70% of respondents stated that open source software is either extremely or very important) or TideLift’s April 2019 survey report (that found more than 90% of professional developers use open source in building their applications) it is clear that developers from startups to highly regulated enterprises have embraced open source solutions.</description>

Some common themes when talking that have come up include;
 How do I get started on Cloud or AWS? What tools and languages should I learn?</description>
