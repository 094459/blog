      <description>Running my dev.to blog using Hugo on Netlify I am a big fan of dev.to, and the work that the team do to foster a great community of builders is something that keeps me there. I have always maintained another blog (running on Netlify, which is also super awesome), kind of like a mirror. Up until last year, I was able to publish to dev.to and it would take care of publishing to that mirror.</description>
