A little under a year ago I wrote this post:

As 2020 comes to a close, and you reflect on how your year has been it is often a good opportunity to take a look about your year ahead and possibly start to explore new opportunities or your next challenge.

As you think about next year and where you want to go, I wanted to share an exciting opportunity that has opened up in my team, the UK Developer Advocate team. These do not come up often, and the role, the team as well as the business are just amazing to work with/for.

Here is a detailed description of the role, so please reach out to me to understand more about the role, the work we do and any other questions you might have.
