On October 17th we have a free, online event covering several tracks on Machine Learning. Whether you are a complete beginner or seasoned data scientist, we have gentle introductions to deep dives.

What I am most excited about however, is that we will have an AWS DeepRacer racing challenge. You will learn how to create your first reinforcement learning model that will race a virtual car, with prizes for the fastest times.

Here is a link to the event, feel free to check out the agenda and then register if interested.
