So, with reInvent drawing to close and many of the attendees recovering from the after party (re:Play), I thought I would put together a curated list of the open source sessions that have been running this week.

We had a great variety of open source sessions, covering topics from data and data analytics to robotics. If you missed these sessions, you can check out the videos in this post below. They are sorted by category to help you find those that are of most interest to you.

#### Mobile and Front End development

I will kick off with the "Leadership session on innovation in mobile and web app development". This session covers AWS Amplify (including the newly announced Amplify Datastore) and GraphQL and showcases how a couple of customers are using these technologies. View the video here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9vobRSMvV8

In this state of the union, find out about AWS Amplify and what new features have been released in 2019 -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtfjjjaFF3A

One of the hot sessions from reInvent was the session on "Building modern APIs with GraphQL". Check out the video here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aJItKmoeWo

"Developing serverless GraphQL architectures using AWS AppSync" provides a customer story (BMW) and a deep dive on how to use GraphQL with the broader AWS services - > https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVU4pYeNfNo

"Production grade full stack apps with AWS Amplify" walks through a sample use case and how you can use AWS Amplify and GraphQL to build production grade applications. You can then check out the project via the GitHub repo too -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcrtvgaVdCU

A great deep dive on AWS Amplify (including native IOS/Android and Datastore), check out this session "Speed up native mobile development with AWS Amplify" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3hLlHNCjbQ 


#### DevOps

There were a number of great sessions covering the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) - this deep dive video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9As_ZIjUGmY) but my favourite session (Contributing to the construct library) has yet to be uploaded, so I will update as and when it has.

Probably my favorite session - in this session you will learn how to contribute to CDK, including running through a sample PR - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqKxp5MzuVA

#### Data and Data Analytics

The leadership session on analytics and data lakes by Andi Gutmans covered a lot of the open source technologies that customers can use, including some of the new announcements and features during preInvent. Well worth starting off with this -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5QVCFNN4ns

"One query language for all your data" introduces PartiQL and how it is used in several AWS services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3 select and Amazon QLDB. This session also covers the open source project and how you can get involved  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsEOhCOFOe4

With the recently addition of Apache Hudi in EMR, this session covers common use cases that drove the creation of this project and how you can get started. Check out the video here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ckNyL_Nr1A

There were plenty of session on Open Distro for Elasticsearch; as security is job zero, why not start with the session on securing your Open Distro for Elasticsearch cluster (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr4VR2gvO9I)  

In the session "Responding to customer needs in real time with Amazon MSK", learn about the foundations of real time analytics and find out how Adobe are using Amazon MSK in their Adobe Experience Platform - check out the video here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78iBw1CrlsE

There were some great sessions covering open source database technologies. In the "Leadership session: AWS purpose built databases", the second part of the session does a deeper dive and demo of Amazon Managed Apache Cassandra. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q81TVuV5u28&list=PL2yQDdvlhXf8j0dn2Eji_gRtWnRB9rK-G&index=4 If you want to know more about MySQL in AWS Aurora, this deep dive session is for you:  AWS Aurora with MySQL compatibility -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTbApwie2dM and more open source database goodness with this session on PostgresSQL; self managed, managed and serverless - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJDDGscbsms
