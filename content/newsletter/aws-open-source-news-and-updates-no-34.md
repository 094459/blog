## September 7th - Instalment #34

Week No.34, and another packed issue with some great posts, projects and events covering all your favourite open source projects. This week there has been a lot of focus on Bottlerocket, which went GA last week, so plenty of stuff to read as well as several videos to watch. There are a couple of events happening later this week, so check the events just a little below and save the date in your diary.

Before you get on with the rest of this newsletter, I just want to share this event happening in a couple of weeks that I have helped shape. I would urge you to set aside some time if you can, as each of these speakers are subject matter experts in their topics.

[Dev Day: Open source edition](https://pages.awscloud.com/EMEA-field-OE-DevDay-OpenSource-2020-reg-event.html) - if you haven't already done so, this is a must attend event, with four excellent sessions covering open source topics from Kubernetes networking, looking at different options on running Apache Flink, building machine learning workflows with Kubernetes and Kubeflow Pipelines and finally full-stack TypeSafety with React, GraphQL, and TypeScript. Use the link on that page to sign up and then sit back with the glow of satisfaction.

### Your feedback matters!

I have put together a short feedback survey, which I would ask you to take - it will take no more than 2 minutes. You can access [here](https://amazonmr.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8BsYTwgVY6E6WZn). Many thanks!
