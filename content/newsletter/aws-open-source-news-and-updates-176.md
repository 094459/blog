## October 23rd, 2023 - Instalment #176

Welcome to #176 of the AWS open source newsletter, heading into Autumn and getting ready for the clocks to go back later in the week. How will you use that extra hour? Well, perhaps some of you might use it to check out this weeks new projects, which include a nice cli chat tool that uses Amazon Bedrock, a tool to help simplify deploying VSCode in the Cloud environments, and sample demos and code on chaos engineering, deploying Amazon Bedrock via AWS Lambda, and how you can use IAM Roles Anywhere to authenticate against external identity providers.

Or maybe you might use that extra hour to read up on the latest open source content, which this week features content on LangChain, Trivy, AWS CDK, Apache Spark, Pinecone, Redis, Postgres, pgVector, OpenSearch, ClickHouse, Chroma,  Apache Iceberg, CfnGuard, Kubernetes, Karpenter, Kubecost, Amazon Corretto, NextJS, AWS Amplify, GraphQL, Ray, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, Grafana, Core WCF, AWS SAM, Amazon EMR on EKS, RabbitMQ, and Swift. That lot should keep you going. 

Before you dive into the newsletter, I have a quick poll that I am looking to get more data points on. When you use open source projects, and integrate those with other services or technologies, I am looking to find out as a developer where you prefer to have the documentation. In the project repo, or with the technology you are integrating with? Please [vote here](https://twitter.com/094459/status/1714701951865168193), or add your a comment if you have another thought.

**Feedback**

Before you dive in however, I need your help!  Please please please take 1 minute to [complete this short survey](https://www.pulse.aws/promotion/10NT4XZQ) and you will forever have my gratitude! 

### Celebrating open source contributors

The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created.

So thank you to the following open source heroes:  Rio Astamal, Parnab Basak, Efi Merdler-Kravitz, k.goto, dB., Elliott Cordo,  Rajdip Chaudhuri, Avijit Goswami, Rajarshi Sarkar, Abi Asija, Verdant Ari Jain, Jonathan Katz, and Sebastien Stormacq.

### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution. The projects mentioned here do not represent any formal recommendation or endorsement, I am just sharing for greater awareness as I think they look useful and interesting!*

#### Tools

**ask-bedrock**

[ask-bedrock](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3bh) is a new project that provide a command line interface that enables you to converse with your favourite Amazon Bedrock large language model. This tool is a wrapper around the low-level Amazon Bedrock APIs and Langchain. Its main added value is that it locally persists AWS account and model configuration to enable quick and easy interaction.

**installer-vscode-for-web**

[installer-vscode-for-web](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3bf) is another tool from my fellow DA, Rio Astamal that simplifies the steps needed to turn your fresh cloud VM into fully functional VS Code for the web with HTTPS enabled. You can work from any device as long as it supports a modern web browser.

![demo screenshot of project](https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/469847/275777169-60a3fe97-3296-479a-a772-4c0649ff794b.png)

**operatorpkg**

[operatorpkg](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3bg) is a set of packages used to develop Kubernetes operators at AWS. It contains opinions on top of existing projects like https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery and https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime. In many cases, we plan to mature packages in operatorpkg before commiting them upstream.

### Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops

**lambda-bedrock-integration**

[lambda-bedrock-integration](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3be) This sample repository from my colleague Parnab Basak has sample code to integrate AWS Lambda with Amazon Bedrock. .NET, Python, Java, and NodeJS runtimes are supported, and you can use this with AWS SAM.

![architecture of lambda bedrock](https://github.com/ParnabBasak/lambda-bedrock-integration/blob/main/aws-sam-deployments.png?raw=true)

**chaosinjection-lambda-samples**

[chaosinjection-lambda-samples](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3bd)  This repository contains a code sample demonstrating how to inject chaos into AWS Lambda functions seamlessly. By leveraging AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS), it allows you to simulate real-world unpredictable conditions like increased latency or random function failures, without modifying your function's original code. I have featured Efe's project in an earlier newsletter ([#167](https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-newsletter-167-5bg7)), and he has taken an innovative solution for injecting chaos into AWS Lambda via FIS and enhanced it. If you are heading out to re:Invent, he will be giving a talk on integrating Rust with AWS Lambda, so be sure to check that out.

**blog-devops-iamra**

[blog-devops-iamra](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3al) this repo provides code that shows you how you can combine IAM Roles Anywhere and an existing public key infrastructure (PKI) to authenticate external build agents to AWS by using short-lived certificates to obtain AWS temporary credentials. You can follow along and build this by reading the supporting blog post, [Enable external pipeline deployments to AWS Cloud by using IAM Roles Anywhere](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/3ag)

### Quick updates

**Amazon Corretto**

On Oct 17, 2023 Amazon announced quarterly security and critical updates for Amazon Corretto Long-Term Supported (LTS) versions of OpenJDK. Corretto 21.0.1, 17.0.9, 11.0.21, and 8u392 are now [available for download](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2y6). Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. 

**Core WCF**

We had a couple of important updates for .NET developers last week.

Starting off with news that the .NET open-source team announced the release of CoreWCF v1.4.0 GA and CoreWCF v1.5.0-preview1. While 1.4.0-preview had generic Queue transport and RabbitMQ implementation, we received an open-source contribution for Apache Kafka implementation on top of our generic transport implementation. We have included this contribution in 1.4.0 GA which would enable Amazon Managed Kafka out of the box for dispatching and processing messages. They also released CoreWCF v1.5.0-preview1 which has additional binding implementation using Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for CoreWCF and the WCF Client. Unix Domain Socket in CoreWCF and WCF Client will unlock an alternative for NetNamedPipe on Linux. NetNamedPipe only works on Windows, while UDS is cross-platform and is supported on both Linux and Windows. This is also the second most voted feature request in the CoreWCF open-source repository. With this launch in addition to adding a direct alternative in Linux, we are removing another hurdle for our customers to move to Linux with WCF applications using Named Pipes. 

Following that was an update that the .NET open-source team announced last week support for Amazon SQS in Core WCF. They released aws-corewcf-extensions, an open-source project to augment Core WCF and the support for Amazon SQS therein. Customers can now use Amazon SQS queues with CoreWCF applications as they modernise their WCF applications to CoreWCF using the NuGet packages AWS.CoreWCF.Extensions and AWS.WCF.Extensions. This SQS support is built on top of CoreWCF.Queue implementation that currently powers CoreWCF.RabbitMQ and CoreWCF.Kafka which further works with AmazonMQ and Amazon MSK. This launch adds Amazon SQS on top of these existing extensions.  In addition, aws-corewcf-extensions will act as a foundational open-source project to build other AWS service integrations to work with CoreWCF as the customer needs arise. This will also provide both internal AWS builders and external .NET community with an opportunity to build AWS integrations into a cohesive repository that is supported with a pipeline to ship packages to NuGET. 

**AWS SAM**

Developers using SAM CLI to author their serverless application with Lambda functions can now create and use Lambda test events to test their function code. Test events are JSON objects that mock the structure of requests emitted by AWS services to invoke a Lambda function and return an execution result, serving to validate a successful operation or to identify errors. Previously, Lambda test events were only available in the Lambda console. With this launch, developers using SAM CLI can create and access a test event from their AWS account and share it with other team members. This capability makes it easier for developers using SAM CLI to collaborate and streamline testing workflows. It also allows developers to use a consistent set of test events across their entire team. Developers can make test events available to other team members in their AWS account using granular IAM permissions.

**OpenSearch**

The Amazon OpenSearch Service has expanded its geospatial capacities. With new aggregation support in version 2.9, you can do more statistical analysis on your data, making it simpler to draw conclusions and interpret them. With Amazon OpenSearch Service Version 2.9, we have added Geo Bounds, Geo Centroid, Geo Hash, and Geo Title. The new aggregations are available through OpenSearch APIs. Different aggregations can be used to gather insights on high-level overview of trends, patterns and establish co-relations within the data. 

In other OpenSearch news, security analytics in Amazon OpenSearch Service added native support for Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) formatted data, that provides security detection rules for OCSF data ingested from Amazon Security Lake. In addition, security analytics also supports ingesting virtually any custom log type and creating custom detection rules. Correlation engine helps reduce incident response time by analysing and highlighting connections between potential security incidents. Previously, customers had to map and convert OCSF data to another supported format to run security detection rules. Now, security analytics supports OCSF formatted data and includes the ability to run detection and correlation rules on this data. Along with currently supported security event log sources, customers asked to support custom application logs. By extending the security capabilities supported for prepackaged log types to custom log types, customers can get a comprehensive view of security events across their organisation. Using the correlation engine, customers can detect relationships between logs generated from different sources, helping to reduce incident detection, analysis, and response times.

If that was not enough, we have more. Search Pipelines is a new feature in OpenSearch 2.9,  that makes it easy to build query and result processing pipelines. This lets you build search query and result processing as a composition of modular processing steps without complicating your application software. Individual processing steps can include query rewriters, natural language processors, result rerankers, and filters. Along with the search pipeline framework, OpenSearch now includes a variety of standard processors: a script processor, which allows you to preprocess search queries with Painless; a search request modifier which lets you add a filter in DSL; a field renamer; and so on. Search Pipelines are also the integration technology on which other important features are built, including score normalisation for hybrid lexical and semantic searching, and AWS Personalize and AWS Kendra reranking. Pipelines can be explicitly invoked for the current query, or can be applied to all search requests on an index.

**Amazon EMR on EKS**

Announced a couple of weeks ago, the Interactive Endpoints for Amazon EMR on EKS enables customers to run interactive workloads using an integrated development environment such as EMR Studio. For customers that require control on their execution environment, they will be able to use their self-hosted Jupyter notebooks as an another mechanism to run their interactive workloads via Interactive Endpoints.

Interactive Endpoints also enhance the flexibility when running interactive workloads with Amazon EMR on EKS. When using Interactive Endpoints, customers will also be able to build a custom image with their application dependencies and use that image in running their interactive jobs using Interactive Endpoints. This is especially useful for customers who may need to use libraries in their code, which are not available in the public distribution of Amazon EMR on EKS Spark runtime. Finally, for enhanced application resiliency and accessibility, Interactive Endpoints also provides customers the full control on the instance type where the JEG pod will be deployed, including the ability to specify on-demand instances via a managed or self-managed node group.

Amazon EMR on EKS Interactive Endpoints are generally available on Amazon EMR on EKS release version 6.10 and later, and is available in all commercial AWS regions where Amazon EMR on EKS is currently available.

**RabbitMQ**

Amazon MQ now provides support for RabbitMQ version 3.11.20, which includes several fixes and improvements to the previous versions of RabbitMQ supported by Amazon MQ - 3.11.16. If you are running earlier versions of RabbitMQ, such as 3.10, 3.9 or 3.8, we strongly encourage you to upgrade to RabbitMQ 3.11. This can be accomplished with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. We also encourage you to enable automatic minor version upgrades on RabbitMQ 3.11 to help ensure your brokers take advantage of future fixes and improvements in 3.11.

**Swift**

AWS announced a couple of weeks ago the general availability of Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) support in CodeArtifact. Swift is the language of choice for developing applications on the Apple platform, and the Swift Package Manager is used to distribute source code in the Swift ecosystem. With SwiftPM support in CodeArtifact, developers can publish and download their Swift package dependencies to their CodeArtifact repository.

CodeArtifact implements the HTTP-based registry protocol for SwiftPM defined in Swift Evolution proposal 0292. Prior to SE-0292, SwiftPM could only consume dependencies stored in Git repositories. Now, packages can be stored outside of Git in a package registry, providing improved build reproducibility, efficiency, and performance. SwiftPM can consume packages stored in Git repositories and package registries as part of the same application build, avoiding the need to migrate all dependencies into registries up front. CodeArtifact SwiftPM works with existing clients such as XCode and the swift CLI. Once packages are stored in CodeArtifact, developers can reference these package dependencies in CodeArtifact with their existing tools.  

Check out the supporting blog post from my colleague Sebastien, [New â€“ Add Your Swift Packages to AWS CodeArtifact](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/39r)
