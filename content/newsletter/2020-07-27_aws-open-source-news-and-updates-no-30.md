## July 27th - Instalment #30

Week No.30 and another week of great projects and posts. We have a new open source builder story, the usual selection of projects from robotics to compliance/governance tools and blog posts that cover topics from machine learning to security and serverless. Another good selection of cases studies and customers who are using open source to make a difference as well as some events you should check out and add to your diary.

#### Open source builders - Justin Garrison

Last week I had the chance to chat with Justin Garrison, developer advocate in the containers team at AWS about his journey in open source. You can listen to the podcast, it is certainly worth listening to as Justin shares some real gems that are relevant to all builders thinking about taking their first steps in open source.

Read more in this post, [Podcast - open source builders: Justin Garrison](https://dev.to/aws/podcast-open-source-builders-justin-garrison-2pfp)

If you want to take part then please contact me as I am currently organising recording of the next batch.

I shared Matt's post last week ([here](https://dev.to/nideveloper/cdk-patterns-at-20-let-s-walk-through-all-20-serverless-patterns-for-aws-d1n)) which is worth reading again. This is a great effort and provides organisations with a way to accelerate their teams building consistent, bar raising infrastructure to support their applications.

**Halter and the Cow Collar**

[The Cow Collar Wearable: How Halter benefits from FreeRTOS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/the-cow-collar-wearable-how-halter-benefits-from-freertos/) - Tanmoy Sen and Arun Viswanathan have put this post that appeals to my farming roots back in Galicia (dairy farming and potatoes!). Halter is an agri-tech original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that focuses on cattle herd management. Halter creates GPS enabled, solar powered smart collars for cows. The collar hardware allows farmers to interact with an easy-to-use app to remotely set geographic boundaries for cattle or virtual fences. Farmers use Halter’s system to avoid physically herding cows, maximizing farmer time and productivity.

![cows](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/c5b76da3e608d34edb07244cd9b875ee86906328/2020/07/16/Screen-Shot-2020-07-16-at-7.24.26-PM.png)

This post shows how FreeRTOS helped Halter solve a number of challenges when building this solution, and shows you how you could adapt this for your own agri-tech use case.

**Caresyntax & Reddis**

[How caresyntax uses managed database services for better surgical outcomes](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/how-caresyntax-uses-managed-database-services-for-better-surgical-outcomes/) -  guest post from Ken Wu, Chief Technology Officer, and Steve Gordon, Director of Engineering at caresyntax, and looks how they combine both managed open source services from AWS, native AWS services and open source projects such as Redis to create Periop Insight, which is a surgical data analytics solution for today’s busy preoperative leaders to improve their operating room (OR) performance. It is an enterprise software-as-a-service (SaaS) web application that works on desktops, tablets, and phone form factors. Although many modern data-centric applications deal with extremely large volumes of data, Periop Insight’s challenges stemmed from the complexity of the data, not volume. This is a fascinating read, so check it out.

### Quick updates

**Amazon Elasticsearch**

Amazon Elasticsearch Service now supports open source Elasticsearch 7.7 and its corresponding version of Kibana. This minor release includes bug fixes and enhancements. This release improves cluster stability by significantly reducing the amount of heap memory that is needed to keep Lucene segments open. It also delivers faster results when querying time-based indices by filtering out shards that do not contain documents with relevant timestamps. We also added support for regular expressions in Painless scripts.

Amazon Elasticsearch Service domains running Elasticsearch 7.7 include support for recently released features like custom dictionaries, UltraWarm, and cross-cluster search. The release also includes support for features like anomaly detection, and SQL Workbench that are components of Open Distro for Elasticsearch, an Apache 2.0-licensed distribution of Elasticsearch. 

**CIS Benchmark for Amazon EKS**

The new CIS Benchmark for Amazon EKS helps you accurately assess the secure configuration of nodes running as part of your Amazon EKS clusters. 

Security is a critical consideration for configuring and maintaining Kubernetes clusters and applications. [The Center for Internete Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/) provides good practice guidance on security configurations for self-managed Kubernetes clusters, but did not accurately help evaluate the security configuration status for the AWS-managed Kubernetes clusters run by Amazon EKS. Not all of the recommendations from the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark were applicable to EKS clusters as customers are not responsible for configuring or managing the control plane.

Now, the CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark provides accurate guidance for node security configurations for EKS. The benchmark is applicable to EC2 nodes (both managed and self-managed) where you are responsible for security configurations of Kubernetes components. The benchmark provides a standard, community-approved way to ensure that you have configured your Kubernetes cluster and nodes securely when using Amazon EKS. 

The CIS Amazon EKS Benchmark consists of four sections; control plane logging configuration, node security configurations, policies, and managed services. The benchmark supports the Kubernetes versions currently available from Amazon EKS (v1.15 - v1.17) and can be run using kube-bench, a standard open source tool for checking configuration using the CIS benchmark on Kubernetes clusters.

**AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI now GA**

The AWS Serverless Application Model Command Line Interface (SAM CLI) is now generally available. SAM CLI is a deployment toolkit that also allows you to locally build, test, and debug serverless applications. SAM CLI v.1.0.0 is a stable version recommended for building production serverless applications.  

Previously, SAM CLI was available in beta, supported by the docker-lambda emulation images developed by Michael Hart (AWS Serverless Hero). Now, v1.0.0 is supported by AWS provided emulation images. This version also includes new build support for custom AWS Lambda runtimes and AWS Lambda Layers.  

SAM CLI enables you to easily build serverless applications using a number of commands, including sam init, sam build, and sam deploy. Using sam build, you can compile your application code and dependencies. To compile Custom AWS Lambda runtimes and AWS Lambda Layers, you can include the BuildMethod property in your SAM template under the function or layer resource. The BuildMethod is either an AWS Lambda runtime or Makefile, which defines a set of tasks to be executed. 

**Amazon EFS CSI driver no GA**

The Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) CSI driver is now generally available. The EFS CSI driver makes it simple to configure elastic file storage for both EKS and self-managed Kubernetes clusters running on AWS using standard Kubernetes interfaces. Applications running in Kubernetes can use EFS file systems to share data between pods in a scale-out group, or with other applications running within or outside of Kubernetes. EFS can also help Kubernetes applications be highly available because all data written to EFS is written to multiple AWS Availability zones. If a Kubernetes pod is terminated and relaunched, the CSI driver will reconnect the EFS file system, even if the pod is relaunched in a different AWS Availability Zone. 

With the 1.0 release, the EFS CSI driver now has in-transit encryption enabled by default, helping companies meet their security and compliance goals. Additionally, the driver now supports EFS Access Points, application-specific entry points into an EFS file system that make it easier to share a file system between multiple pods. Access points can enforce a user identity for all file system requests that are made through the access point, and enforce a root directory for each pod.

I thought this was an interesting comment:

>We believe that the broader technology industry can use open source governance models to address more widespread industry challenges that could not be as easily solved with more traditional, proprietary solutions

[Managing issues in a large-scale open source project](https://medium.com/flutter/managing-issues-in-a-large-scale-open-source-project-b3be6eecae2b) - really liked this post on how the Flutter team triage and deal with issues at scale. Even if you are a small project, understand how to effectively work with issues is one of the basis of your open source developer flow and this post will provide some insights on how to do that well.

[Solving technical debt with open source](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/07/solving-technical-debt-with-open-source/) - whilst we often talk about the need to stay close to upstream projects to avoid the burden of managing a fork, in this study with Samsung, it is good to see some real world evidence of this.

[Choosing open source as a marketing strategy](https://opensource.com/article/20/7/open-source-marketing) this is a great post, and provide a good example of the network effects of making your source available: whether that is code that developers can use/modify/run or copy, or the ingredients for beer, open source can be an effective way to increase your reach and build brand.
