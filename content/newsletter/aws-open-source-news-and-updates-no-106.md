### AWS and Community blog posts

**DataHub**

[DataHub](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ip) is an open-source metadata platform for the modern data stack. Gary Stafford has put together a new blog post, [End-to-End Data Discovery, Observability, and Governance on AWS with LinkedInâ€™s Open-source DataHub](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1iq) that dives deep into the topic of data cataloging options (open source and commercial), before diving deep on DataHub, showing how you can integrate this within AWS and some AWS services. Another must read post from Gary. [hands on]

![architecture of DataHub on AWS](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-2DT-TQ-UZ06WAL_eIx9TQ.png)

**MySQL**

If you are looking to connect to MySQL databases in your AWS Lambda functions, then this post from Randy Westergren, [Building pymssql (FreeTDS) for Lambda](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1id) elaborates from a previous post of his, and this time he shows you how he built the Lambda layer. [hands on]

**Openswan**

Openswan is an IPsec implementation for Linux, and I have used this myself many times when creating site to site VPNs between my home network and my VPN Gateway in a VPC. In this post from the folks at Kloudvm, [AWS Site to Site VPN Using OpenSwan IPSEC Step By Step Tutorial](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ie), they share their way of setting this up. [hands on]

**Observability**

This post came from the always excellent [weekly newsletter from Michael Hausenblas, o11y news!](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1if) (make sure you sign up so you don't miss it). In the post, Who watches the watchers?, Miedwar Meshbesher shares a great post on how to make sure that you watch your monitoring tools - very much a case of watching the watchmen. This is a detailed walk through and tutorial of how you can do this, made easier by the fact that the code is provided as Terraform HCL. Very nice post, make sure you check this out. [hands on]

**OrgFormation**

Setting up a multi-account AWS environment is a great series of posts from AWS Hero, Matt Lewis that looks at building out a multi-account best practice landing zone, using an open source tool that regular readers of this newsletter will be familiar with, AWS Organization Formation (OrgFormation) from Olaf Conijn. Building on some great work from another AWS Hero, Michael Bahr, you will learn more about how you can use this project and take advantage of features to help you enforce security and compliance, and incident response. [hands on]

![architecture](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--cLvYwT_9--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/mibcsf8o8ef0a3k5i8a9.png)

**Terraform**

AWS Proton is a fully managed application deployment service for containers and serverless that platform teams can use to connect and coordinate all the different tools needed for infrastructure provisioning, code deployments, monitoring, and updates in a curated self-service interface for developers. The self-service interface provides developers access to approved infrastructure to build and deploy their applications. Aaron Wishnick takes a deep dive in how you can set this up in a two part blog, [AWS Proton Terraform Templates](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1i0) and [AWS Proton Self-Managed Provisioning](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1hz). One of the must read posts this week! [hands on]

![architecture of AWS Proton on Terraform](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2022/03/23/aws-proton-3.jpg)

**Hugging Face Transformers**

In this two part blog, Heiko Hotz provides a practical guide for organisations so you can assess the quality of text summarisation models for your domain. Text summarisation is the capability of a computer to read a given text and summarise its content. Itâ€™s one of the hardest tasks for a computer because it combines two fields within the field of natural language processing (NLP): reading comprehension and text generation. Dive deeper by reading part one, [Set up a text summarization project with Hugging Face Transformers: Part 1](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1i1) and the creatively titled part two, [Set up a text summarization project with Hugging Face Transformers: Part 2](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1i2) - I wonder if anyone is working on a GPT-3 model for creating titles ;-D! [hands on]

![architecture overview](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2022/03/09/ML-7391-image002.png)

**Quarkus**

Quarkus offers Java developers the capability of building native images based on GraalVM. Joan Bonilla shares how to integrate the Quarkus framework with AWS Lambda functions, using the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) in this post, [Deploy Quarkus-based applications using AWS Lambda with AWS SAM](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1i6) [hands on]

**Kubernetes**

A couple of note worthy posts this week.

First up we have Jonathan Katz with the post, [Deploy Amazon RDS databases for applications in Kubernetes](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1i8) that walks you through deploying Jira, into a Kubernetes cluster provided by Amazon EKS, using Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL as the database. [hands on]

Following that we have a post that describes how you can send events from your Kubernetes cluster to a Slack channel using BotKube. BotKube is a messaging bot for monitoring and debugging Kubernetes clusters. Elamaran Shanmugam, Jayaprakash Alawala, and Re Alvarez-Parmar have collaborated on this post, [Streaming Kubernetes Events in Slack](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1i7), to show you how. [hands on]

![architecture for botkube](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2022/03/21/botkube-architecture.jpg)

### Quick updates

**Amazon Corretto**

Amazon Corretto 18 is now generally available. This version supports the latest Java feature release OpenJDK 18 and is available on Linux, Windows, and macOS. OpenJDK 18 offers a new Internet-Address resolution capability, a Simple Web Server, an updated Vector API, a new @snippet Tag for JavaDoc, a new implementation of Core Reflection, a change to UTF-8 as the default character set (charset) of the standard Java APIs, a second iteration of the foreign memory API, advancements in pattern matching for switch statements, and the deprecation of finalisation.

Read more about these in the announcement, [Amazon Corretto 18 is now generally available](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1hx) as well as [this tweet from OpenJDK](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ic)

**AWS GameKit**

AWS GameKit is a new open source solution that allows game developers to deploy and customise game backend features directly from Unreal Engine. AWS GameKit comes with AWS CloudFormation templates for each feature that follows AWS Solution Architect designs. AWS GameKit also comes with an integration code between the game backend features and Unreal Engine. 

AWS GameKit is for game developers looking to build AWS-powered game features directly from Unreal Engine with just a few clicks. With this release, developers have access to four game backend features: Identity and Authentication, Achievements, Game State Cloud Saving, and User Gameplay Data. AWS GameKit uses AWS CloudFormation templates to provision and connect all the necessary AWS resources together into a cohesive solution to power these features. Each feature follows the AWS well-architected framework to provide a secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure deployment that is fully customisable and runs in the developer's own AWS account.

AWS GameKit also provides Unreal Engine Blueprints, C++ code, libraries, documentation, and sample UIs for each of the four game features. The provided AWS CloudFormation templates automatically configure cloud resources that allows game developers to programmatically apply AWS best practices with common abstractions. This leads to the rapid creation of cloud-connected game features without being an AWS expert.

**Proton for Terraform Open Source**

Following on from this [Tweet from Rafael Alvarez](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1hw), the support for Terraform in Proton is now GA.

AWS Proton support for defining infrastructure in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and provisioning infrastructure using Terraform Open Source is now generally available in all regions where Proton is available. Platform teams can now define AWS Proton templates using Terraform modules, in addition to CloudFormation. AWS Proton leverages the customer-managed Terraform automation to provision or update the infrastructure. Customers can use Terraform as their infrastructure definition and provisioning tool, and AWS Proton keeps modules that are used consistently up to date. This generally available launch includes support for BitBucket repositories for infrastructure management, and improved messaging across the service to further clarify the status of provisioning.

**AWS Amplify**

AWS Amplify announces the new @mapsTo GraphQL directive, enabling developers to iterate and rename their GraphQL models without worrying about data migration. The AWS Amplify CLI is a command line toolchain that helps frontend developers create app backends in the cloud. With Amplifyâ€™s GraphQL Transformer, developers can configure their backend data model using the GraphQL Schema Definition Language, and Amplify CLI automatically transforms the schema into a fully functioning GraphQL API with its underlying database tables.

Before today, developers were required to manually export and migrate data when making changes to their GraphQL model names. Customers can now use the @mapsTo directive to rename the client-facing GraphQL model and retain the underlying DynamoDB table data. Amplify CLI, under the hood, will remap the new GraphQL model name to the original underlying DynamoDB tables.

### Videos of the week

**AWS Genomics CLI**

The AWS Genomics CLI (or AGC) removes all the grunt work involved in setting up bioinformatics pipelines to run in the cloud. We know that Snakemake, Cromwell, NextFlow and miniWDL all work happily in the cloud on AWS Batch, but AGC means you don't have to know to set all that stuff up - it does it for you. You can have completely separate tool chains using completely different workflow languages all running at the same time, on the same infrastructure (if you like), sharing data and tooling.

Brendan Bouffler and Lee Pang from the dev team that built this shows how it works, and - most importantly - how easy it is to get productive. Zero to hero in less than 30 mins - it's really impressive.
