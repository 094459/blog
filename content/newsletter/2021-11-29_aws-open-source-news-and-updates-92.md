### AWS and Community blog posts

**Linux**

Really excited about the announcement last week, of the public preview of Amazon Linux 2022 (AL2022), Amazon's new general purpose Linux for AWS, and I know a lot of folk have been working really hard on this one. Starting with AL2022, a new Amazon Linux major version will be available every two years and each version will be supported for five years. Customers will also be able to take advantage of quarterly updates via minor releases and use the latest software for their applications. Finally, AL2022 provides the ability to lock to a specific version of the Amazon Linux package repository giving customers control over how and when they absorb updates. AL2022 uses the Fedora project as its upstream to provide customers with a wide variety of the latest software, such as updated language runtimes, as part of quarterly releases. In addition, AL2022 has SELinux enabled and enforced by default.

You can read the full announcement over at, [Announcing preview of Amazon Linux 2022](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/157) and you can take a look at the GitHub repo, [amazon-linux-2022](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/158)

Following that, we had Joanne Moore and Jim Weingarten announce the updated Amazon Linux Ready Program, which will now validate AWS Partner software products that run on Amazon Linux 2 as well as the next-generation Amazon Linux 2022. You read the details in their post, [Amazon Linux Ready Program Updated to Include the Next-Generation Amazon Linux Operating System](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/154)

### Quick updates

**Grafana**

Amazon Managed Grafana announces new data source plugins for Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift, enabling customers to query, visualise, and alert on their Athena and Redshift data from Amazon Managed Grafana workspaces. Amazon Managed Grafana now also supports CloudFlare, Zabbix, and Splunk Infrastructure Monitoring data sources as well as the Geomap panel visualisation and open source Grafana version 8.2.

Read the full announcement in, [Amazon Managed Grafana adds support for Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift data sources and Geomap visualization](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/156)

**PostgreSQL**

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) Proxy now supports RDS for PostgreSQL and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL - Compatible Edition major version 12. PostgreSQL 12 includes better management of indexing, improved partitioning capabilities, JSON path queries per SQL/JSON specifications, and many other additional features. RDS Proxy is a fully managed and a highly available database proxy for Aurora and RDS databases. RDS Proxy helps improve application scalability, resiliency, and security.

**Terraform**

AWS Proton now supports the definition of infrastructure in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and the provisioning of infrastructure using Terraform Open Source through a git-based workflow. Platform teams define AWS Proton templates using Terraform modules, and AWS Proton leverages the customer-managed Terraform automation to provision or update the infrastructure. Customers can use Terraform as their infrastructure definition and provisioning tool, and AWS Proton will ensure that modules are used consistently and kept up to date. Read more in the announcement, [AWS Proton now supports Terraform Open Source for infrastructure provisioning](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/155) and the post from my colleague Marcia Villalba, [New â€“ AWS Proton Supports Terraform and Git Repositories to Manage Templates](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/15b)

**Amazon Redshift**

Native support for open source SQLAlchemy (sqlalchemy-redshift) and Apache Airflow frameworks are now available for Amazon Redshift. The updated Amazon Redshift dialect for SQLAlchemy supports the Amazon Redshift open source Python driver. With this release you can use single sign-on with your Identity Provider (IdP) to connect to Redshift clusters and avoid credential management pains. You can also use new Amazon Redshift features such as using TIMESTAMPTZ and TIMETZ datatypes when you migrate to the latest Redshift dialect for SQL Alchemy and Apache Airflow. These features are available in sqlalchemy-redshift version 0.8.6 and later.

Apache Airflow has added RedshiftSQLHook and RedshiftSQLOperator that allows Airflow users to execute Amazon Redshift operations. RedshiftSQLHook leverages the Amazon Redshift open source Python driver (redshift_connector) that supports authenticating via IAM or your Identity Provider supported in SQLAlchemy. The integration of Apache Airflow with SQLAlchemy leverages the updated sqlalchemy-redshift.
