### Latest from open source projects

**ecs-files-composer**
[ecs-files-composer](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qs) and useful open source project from John Preston, ECS Files Composer, is a small program that will allow users to define files they need pulled out of AWS Services, such as AWS S3 or AWS SSM Parameter Store, and load the content to a given location, adding builtin capabilities to set file ownership, mode, and other handy features. Great examples, use cases and top notch documentation as you would expect from a project form Mr Preston. Nice work.

**lucid-dynamodb**

[lucid-dynamodb](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qj) Dinesh Sonachalam has put together this open source project that is Python wrapper for AWS DynamoDB, and he provides plenty of documentation and examples to help you get going with this project.

**kubectl-trace**

[kubectl-trace](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qi) this new project, kubectl trace, is a kubectl plugin that allows you to schedule the execution of bpftrace programs in your Kubernetes cluster. [bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) is a high-level tracing language for Linux enhanced Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) available in recent Linux kernels (4.x). This project has good documentation and examples so you can get going.

**tailscale-layer**

[tailscale-layer](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qh) what is this, an open source project from Corey Quinn? Indeed it is, and this project builds an AWS Lambda extension to provide a SOCKS5 proxy inside of the Lambda runtime environment. According to Corey, 

> Tailscale is a next-generation VPN approach that wraps around Wireguard. It offers a useful management interface, uses far less power on mobile devices than options like OpenVPN, and claims to run on almost anything.
> In other words, this extension can be used with any existing Lambda function to provide communication across your Tailscale network â€” without having to configure a bunch of network rules that, frankly, don't work very well across different provider boundaries. 
> So far, I've used the extension to have Lambda functions talk to: The Raspberry Pi in my video production studio/guest room/sewing closet/screamatorium. My massively overpowered instance running in Oracle Cloud's yes-it's-actually-free tier. My iPhone and iPad. Resources living inside of my AWS VPCs, without having to use a NAT instance or Managed NAT Gateway to allow those functions to also speak to external resources.

Read more in the blog post he put around this, in [Corey Writes Open-Source Code for Lambda and Tailscale](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/q6)

**serverless-mux-on-aws**

[serverless-mux-on-aws](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qx) new project from Pahud Hsieh, that shows you how you can do a local build, test and deploy your [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) application for both AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate with AWS CDK.

![arch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pahud/serverless-mux-on-aws/63e544f85d44a4de606ad2f4ad06e93578e82fd0/images/serverless-mux-go.svg)

**blog-multi-arch-springboot**

[blog-multi-arch-springboot](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qf) an open source project that shows you how you can build a multi-architecture pipeline to deploy a sample application (in this instance a Spring Boot app) onto any architecture type and to any location (thanks to the ECS Anywhere capability of Amazon ECS). The python CDK application builds everything you need, and I have written a blog post that will walk you through this in [Creating a multi architecture CI/CD deployment for Amazon ECS and ECS Anywhere](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qg)

### Community open source posts

**Firecracker**

Tal Hoffman dives deep in his blog post, [Firecracker internals: a deep dive inside the technology powering AWS Lambda](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qz) guiding you through some of the Firecracker code. An often forgotten fact that sometimes just going through the source code of open source projects like Firecracker is one of the best ways to improve your understanding of it. Very nice post.

**Apache Hudi**

Dhiraj Thakur, Sameer Goel, and Imtiaz Sayed have come together to write this first in a series of posts, [Query an Apache Hudi dataset in an Amazon S3 data lake with Amazon Athena part 1: Read-optimized queries](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qw). This series will look at Athena and Apache Hudi, and will provide a short overview of key Hudi capabilities along with detailed procedures for using read-optimized queries, snapshot queries, and bootstrapped tables. [hands on]

**Apache Flink/Grafana**

John Mousa and Sascha Janssen have put together this blog post, [Near real-time processing with Amazon Kinesis, Amazon Timestream, and Grafana](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qd) is part of a series of posts  that aim to explore various patterns for data ingestion and cost-effective architecture pipelines. This particular looks at device telemetry uses cases. You will see how you can monitor your devicesâ€™ operations by visualising operational data with Grafana, using Apache Flink to transforms and aggregate streaming data in near-real time, to detect and clean any errors in time series data timestamps before ingesting them in Timestream to optimise operational analytics.

![overview](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2021/07/06/DBB-1453-image011.png)

**Redis**

In this blog post, [Migrate Amazon ElastiCache to Graviton2 processors](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qm) Scott Kellish, Asaf Porat Stoler, Zach Gardner, and Yaron Sananes explore the performance benefits of Graviton2 instances and how to migrate your ElastiCache for Redis cluster to Graviton2. More and more workloads are moving to Arm, and this is an area where open source projects are helping to unlock the ability for customers to run their workloads on any processor architecture.

Last week we also had Matt Asay and Antony Prasad Thevaraj post, [How AWS and Redis Labs partner to make a better Redis](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qu) which takes a look at how you can both collaborate with and compete with open source. The post explores that in detail as well as taking a look at how it all comes back to how we can best serve our customers.

**Kubernetes**

Param Sharma and Arindam Chatterji show you how to set up end-to-end encryption on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) with AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority in the post, [TLS-enabled Kubernetes clusters with ACM Private CA and Amazon EKS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qo). You will learn how you can set up an NGINX ingress controller on Amazon EKS. As part of the example, we show you how to configure an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) with HTTPS using certificates issued via ACM Private CA in front of the ingress controller. [hands on]

[hands on]

### Apache Airflow Summit 2021

In case you missed it, last week was the Airflow Summit, a free online conference for the worldwide community of developers and users of Apache Airflow. There were a few sessions covering Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA), as well as lots of other great sessions which you should check out.

**Apache Airflow 2.0 on Amazon MWAA**

https://www.crowdcast.io/e/airflowsummit2021/39

In this session we will discuss Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA), how Apache Airflow (and specifically version 2.0) is implemented in the service, best practices for deployment and operations, and the Amazon MWAA teamâ€™s commitment to open source usage and contributions.


**MWAA: Design Choices and Road Ahead**

https://www.crowdcast.io/e/airflowsummit2021/53

An informal and fun chat about the journey that we took and the decisions that we made in building Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow. We will talk about Our first tryst with understanding Airflow Talking to Amazon Data Engineers and how they ran workflows at scale Key design decisions and the reasons behind them Road ahead, and what we dream about for future of Apache Airflow. Open-Source tenets and commitment from the team We will leave time at the end for a short AMA/Questions.



### Quick updates

**AWS Toolkit for JetBrains**

In this blog post, [AWS Toolkit for JetBrains now supports Go and TypeScript](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/qp) Kyle Thomson shares how Go and TypeScript are now supported in this open source plugin.

**Amplify Flutter**

Last week the AWS Amplifyâ€™s tools and libraries for Flutter were updated to support null safety for all of our use cases. Flutter developers can now enjoy all the easy-to-integrate Amplify functionality with higher reliability and improved developer ergonomics. Sound null safety is a Dart language feature in which code is non-nullable by default and turns runtime null-dereference errors into edit-time analysis errors. This enables developers to reduce bugs in their code and benefit from performance improvements through smaller binaries and faster execution.

Null safety protection was introduced with Flutter 2 as an opt-in feature for developers and, as of Flutter 2.2, is enabled by default for all new Flutter apps. With this release of Amplify Flutter developers can now create new apps with null safety enabled, and no longer have to wait to migrate their existing apps to be null safe.

**PostgreSQL**

We have updated Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL to support PostgreSQL minor versions 13.3, 12.7, 11.12, 10.17, and 9.6.22. This release closes security vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL and contains bug fixes and improvements done by the PostgreSQL community.

This release also adds support for the oracle_fdw extension, which allows your PostgreSQL database to connect and retrieve data stored in separate Oracle databases.

**FreeRTOS**

FreeRTOS AWS reference integrations are pre-integrated FreeRTOS projects ported to microcontroller-based evaluation boards that demonstrate end-to-end connectivity to AWS IoT Core. This helps developers save months of development effort and accelerate time to market. FreeRTOS AWS reference integrations now include the new managed AWS IoT Over-the-Air update (OTA) library, AWS IoT Jobs library, and the AWS IoT Device Defender custom metrics feature from the FreeRTOS 202012.01 LTS release, and the coreMQTT Agent library from the FreeRTOS 202104.00 release.

Developers can use the reference integrations to get started on a wide variety of evaluation boards and use the integrated libraries to remotely update IoT device firmware, manage IoT device fleets, monitor IoT device fleet metrics, and to simplify the management of MQTT connections in multi-threaded applications.
