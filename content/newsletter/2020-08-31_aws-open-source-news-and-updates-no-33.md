## August 31st - Instalment #33

Week No.33, and as we come to the end of the summer season with people returning back from holiday, it is good to see that there has been no slow down in open source activities. This week we have plenty of blog posts, projects for you to check out and customer stories. 

We also have a growing list of events to add to your diary, so make sure you check these out too. Again, if you have any open source events you want me to share on this newsletter, then please let me know. 

### Something to read

First up is a blog post from Daniele Scasciafratte announcing [An Open-Source Book About the Open Source World](https://hackernoon.com/an-open-source-book-about-the-open-source-world-2h6r3unz), which I am currently working through (the pdf version) and is a kind of hybrid book in such that it reads like an autobiography about Daniele's open source journey. Along the way he shares what he has learnt, and it kind of works as it makes it easier to read than many of the books on this subject. You can start reading via this link [here](https://github.com/mte90/contribute-to-opensource-the-right-way/releases). Nice work Daniele!

### Your feedback matters!

I have put together a short feedback survey, which I would ask you to take - it will take no more than 2 minutes. You can access [here](https://amazonmr.au1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8BsYTwgVY6E6WZn). Many thanks!

### Celebrate open source contributors

The articles posted in this series are only possible thanks to contributors and project maintainers and so I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to build on top of what they have created. 

So thank you to Arpit Mohan, Aram Alipoor, Philipp Garbe, Yoni Augarten, Xiaoyan Zhang, Praveen Kumar Jeyarajan, Viyoma Sachdeva, Iftikhar Khan and Kiran Sahoo, Michael Neil, Polar Squad, Stelligent, Sudhir Jonathan, Pratip Bagchi, Henner Dierks, Angus McAllister, Shubhra Deshpande and Michael Hausenblas

Make sure you find and follow these builders and keep up to date with their open source projects and contributions.

### Fresh blog posts for your reading pleasure

**Apache Hive vs AWS Glue**

[Metadata Management: Hive Metastore vs AWS Glue](https://lakefs.io/2020/08/24/metadata-management-hive-metastore-vs-aws-glue/) this post from Yoni Augarten compares two popular metadata catalogs: Hive Metastore and Amazon Glue. Metadata management tools like these provide a metadata layer, containing the information that identifies and describes the data and are important when building data lakes so you have a mechanisms where you can query to find out information about your data. You can find out more information about [Apache Hive here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted).

**Gov UK on AWS**

[Architectural decisions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/tree/master/docs/architecture/decisions) found this link via Corey's weekly newsletter, and it provides a detailed set of design documents that are made publicly available on how they setup and deploy services on AWS. There is an old blog post dating back to 2011 that shares some of the rational and thinking behind this, which you can read at [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

**Flutter and Amplify**

Then we have some suburban/house objects you can put into your worlds, which you can find [here](https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/athackst/fuel/collections/suburb_sim) and [here](https://github.com/osrf/citysim). These can be useful if you are planning autonomous vehicles or robots that need to navigate these kinds of environments, as you can see in these [videos](http://gazebosim.org/blog/car_sim).

Finally, a short video sent to me via Camilo Buscaron, that is a great ROS2 & Navigation2 demo in Gazebo by Shreyas Gokhale and JdeRobot that uses the AWS Robotics open source warehouse world. Check it out.

**Subversion**

[Migrating Subversion repositories AWS CodeCommit](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/migrating-subversion-repositories-aws-codecommit/) a post from Iftikhar Khan and Kiran Sahoo that shows you how you can migrate your Subversion source control repositories to AWS CodeCommit. It has been a while since I have used svn, but when I speak with enterprise customers, there are still plenty of legacy code repositories that have been kept as is, so this post shows you how you can migrate those repositories.

**OpenSSL**

[Announcing Render Farm Deployment Kit on AWS](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/blog/announcing-render-farm-deployment-kit) is a blog post that introduces a new open source project, Render Farm Deployment Kit (RFDK) for those working in 3D animation, motion graphics, and VFX.  The Render Farm Deployment Kit, lets you use languages like Python and NodeJS to automate the deployment of render farm resources in the cloud. 

RFDK provides constructs for the AWS CDK that deploy and configure components of your cloud-based render farm, making it faster to manually deploy for your farm on AWS by reducing ten thousand of lines of AWS CloudFormation code to two hundred lines in Python. Read the post for all the details including links to the documentation, and you can find the [project repository here](https://github.com/aws/aws-rfdk).

### Case Study

**TalkingData and Deep Java Library - DJL**

[How TalkingData uses AWS open source Deep Java Library with Apache Spark for machine learning inference at scale](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/how-talkingdata-uses-aws-open-source-deep-java-library-with-apache-spark-for-machine-learning-inference-at-scale/) this post via Xiaoyan Zhang, a Data Scientist at TalkingData, looks at how you can use this open source project to simplify and reduce cost when approaching machine learning. TalkingData is a data intelligence service provider that offers data products and services to provide businesses insights on consumer behaviour, preferences, and trends. Deep Java Library (DJL) is a Deep Learning Framework written in Java, supporting both training and inference. DJL is built on top of modern Deep Learning engines (TenserFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, etc.). This post walks you through a machine learning model that TalkingData used to showcase their solution of using DJL to run inference for PyTorch models on Apache Spark, and shows how this approach provided an end-to-end solution to run everything on Apache Spark without involving additional services, and reducing running time by 66% and reduced maintenance costs.

### Quick updates

**Amazon Corretto 8 & 11 support extended**

Amazon is extending long-term support (LTS) for Amazon Corretto 8 from June 2023 to May 2026 and for Amazon Corretto 11 from August 2024 to September 2027. Long-term support (LTS) for Corretto includes security updates and specific performance enhancements released at least quarterly. Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. 


**Seamlessly join an Amazon EC2 for Linux instance to AWS Directory Service**

You can now join your Amazon EC2 for Linux instances to a domain configured with AWS Directory Service seamlessly. The new capability automates the previously manual approach for integrating Linux-based EC2 instances to your  AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed Microsoft AD), or to an existing on-premises Active Directory (AD) using AD Connector. This makes it easier for you to launch and manage your Amazon EC2 for Linux instances, reducing deployment time and administration effort.
