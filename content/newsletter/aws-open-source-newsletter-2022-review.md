**The AWS open source newsletter - review of 2022**

I wanted to kick off 2023 by sharing some data points and things of interest that came up in 2022 as part of writing and putting together this open source newsletter. Given the nature of the newsletter, and that transparency and openness is core to open source, I hope these might be interesting to some of you.

In 2022, I published 45 newsletters over the course of the year. These were enjoyed (I hope) by over 100K readers from across the world and clicked on an average of five of the posts I share each week. . I actually post across two sites, [dev.to](https://dev.to/aws/aws-open-source-news-and-updates-reference-5clm) and my [personal blog](https://blog.beachgeek.co.uk/). Readers came from all over the world, with over 110 countries accessing the newsletter. The top five countries where U.S.A, India, United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany. 

Over 150K words were written, with nearly 3K (2920) open source related articles shared across code, blog posts, videos, and more. We featured over a thousand authors (actual number is 1211), including many first time authors, AWS Heroes, AWS Community Builders, and the broader AWS and open source community. See below for the top ten posts of 2022. 

In 2022, the newsletter introduced you to 931 new open source projects (with 187K clicks throughs) so I hope you were able to check and use a few of these. See below for the top 15 projects. 

I transitioned to using Hugo to build my personal blog, and introduced tagging as a way of being able to better find the favourite open source technologies you like. Over 200 different tags were used to cover the various open source projects.

### Feedback and looking forward to 2023

Thanks for reading this short post to recap 2022. As I look forward to 2023, I am thinking about what themes to cover, what open source technologies to focus on, and ensure that I work back from our customers.

To help I have a very [short survey](https://pulse.buildon.aws/promotion/10NT4XZQ) that I would like you to complete. The [survey link is here](https://pulse.buildon.aws/promotion/10NT4XZQ), and completing the survey will give you the chance to win some SWAG in the Raffle. After completing the survey, you will get a Raffle ticket code. Please ignore the link below this saying you can redeem this in the AWS Console. These are not AWS Credit codes.

**KEEP THE CODE SAVED**

I will publish the winning code in a future edition of the AWS Open Source newsletter.
