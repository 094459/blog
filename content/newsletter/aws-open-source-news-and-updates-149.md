**Feedback**

Please please please take 1 minute to [complete this short survey](https://pulse.buildon.aws/survey/PJRTOUMK) and get some exclusive content as a thank you.

### Celebrating open source contributors

The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created.

So thank you to the following open source heroes: 

### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.*

#### Tools

**mountpoint-s3**

[mountpoint-s3](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m1) was the big news last week, a new project that provides a simple, high-throughput file client for mounting an Amazon S3 bucket as a local file system. One thing to note however, is Mountpoint for Amazon S3 is currently an alpha release and should not be used in production. I enjoyed reading the launch post, [The inside story on Mountpoint for Amazon S3, a high-performance open source file client](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m2) where James Bornholt, Devabrat Kumar, and Andy Warfield show you how you can get started, some of the considerations you need to think about before using it, and then a look behind the scenes at how this tool was developed.

![demo screenshot of mountpoint-s3](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/e1822db470e60d090affd0956d743cb0e7cdf113/2023/03/11/mountpoint-for-amazon-s3-local-file-system-command-line-tools-1024x511.png)

**s3-access-for-squash**

[s3-access-for-squash](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m3) is a great tool if you find yourself working with thousands (or more) small files and Amazon S3. Tools to allow user access files squashed in S3 archive object on demand. If we take an example of a massive small text files archive use case, it is likely you have a large local source code tree wants to be archived to S3. It will be inefficient and costly if you were to inject/ingest tens of thousands files direct to/from S3. With this tool, you can compress and aggregate small files into a single big archive object before upload to S3. Then, when a individual file needs to be accessed later, you can fetch through S3 GetObject API which in behind a S3 Object Lambda function will automatically locate file contents inside of archive object in S3 and extract the only necessary bytes back to user. Very cool indeed.

Make sure you check the notice in the README though, as it does provide additional guidance on how/when to use this:

> S3 Squash Archive target for massive small files archive use case, typically once injected seldom access. if your use case need high frequency access full dataset, please upload your file to S3 Object as normal way, by doing this file to S3 object 1x1 mapping, you can get MAX throughput from S3 and it's most cost effective way.

**amazon-s3-tar-tool**

[amazon-s3-tar-tool](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2ma) or s3tar, is utility tool to create a tarball of existing objects in Amazon S3. s3tar allows customers to group existing Amazon S3 objects into TAR files without having to download the files. This cli tool leverages existing Amazon S3 APIs to create the archives on Amazon S3 that can be later transitioned to any of the cold storage tiers. The files generated follow the tar file format and can be extracted with standard tar tools.

Make sure you read the README as it contains more details around how it works under the hood, some details around pricing considerations, and then some limitations you should be aware of.

**aws-serverless-ai-stories**

[aws-serverless-ai-stories](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m7) this a new project from AWS Serverless Advocate (and open source bar raiser) David Boyne. I really love the idea behind this, and if you have been following David on social media, you will have seen how this project developed. This project is an example of an event-driven application that generates a new bed time story for your children every night using Lambda, EventBridge, DynamoDB, App Runner, ChatGPT and DALL-E.

![overview of architecture of ai stories](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2023/03/14/ai-stories-2.png)

I am happy to say that along with the code, he has put together a blog post,[ Implementing an event-driven serverless story generation application with ChatGPT and DALL-E](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m8), that guides you through implementing this for yourself. This weeks essential read.

![example story produced by project](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2023/03/14/ai-stories-1.png)

**earthquake-notifier**

[earthquake-notifier](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m9) is an example serverless solution based on Lambda (in Rust), EventBridge and SNS to monitor for earthquakes and send email notifications. Under the hood, it uses the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology public APIs (INGV) and scans them every hour.

**amazon-keyspaces-python-util-scripts**

[amazon-keyspaces-python-util-scripts](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m5) if you are looking to investigate Amazon Keyspaces for Apache Cassandra, then these scripts accompany a tutorial ([Scalability and familiarity with Amazon Keyspaces](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m6) )that will help you gain familiarity with this service. I often find that these scripts that are put together for workshops and tutorials are super helpful, so sharing this project for that reason.

### Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops

**multi-simulation-jobs-aws-robomaker-demo**

[multi-simulation-jobs-aws-robomaker-demo](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m4)  is a demo that shows how you can enable communication between ROS2 applications deployed in AWS RoboMaker's multiple simulation jobs. This demo sets up a Docker container format Talker and Listener to do TCP communication through Fast DDS Discovery Server. The source code provides a setting template that can be used when you want to communicate and work with multiple simulation jobs simultaneously using AWS RoboMaker.

### AWS and Community blog posts

**Amazon Linux 2023**

As a big user of Amazon Linux distributions for a while, I am happy that we have now launched the next version, Amazon Linux 2023. In the post, Amazon Linux 2023, a Cloud-Optimized Linux Distribution with Long-Term Support, my colleague Sebastien Stormacq provides a great overview of some of the features, with a focus on security and long term support planning.

![long term support planning for amazon linux 2](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/03/15/ALTimelines_external.png)

**Apache Iceberg**

In the post, [Build a serverless transactional data lake with Apache Iceberg, Amazon EMR Serverless, and Amazon Athena](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2mn), Houssem Chihoub provides a hands on guide on how you can build a serverless transactional data lake with Apache Iceberg on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using Amazon EMR Serverless and Amazon Athena [hands on]

![overview of serverless transactional data lake](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2023/02/24/bdb-2850-image001.jpg)

**Apache Kafka**

There are many options you have when it comes to how you run your Apache Kafka. In this post, [How to choose the right Amazon MSK cluster type for you](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2ml), Ali Alemi shows you his process that may help you work backward from your applicationâ€™s requirements and the resources available to you, to find the right choice for you.

![decision making flowchart for apache kafka options](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2023/03/09/bdb2939-image001-600.png)

**Kubernetes**

Having spent an increasing amount of time immersed in the world of Kubernetes, I found this next post very helpful. Herbert-John Kelly and Andrew Gargan have penned [Automate prework to save time deploying an Amazon EKS Kubernetes cluster](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2mg), that shows you how you can automate a lot of the configuration work you need to do when setting up your Kubernetes clusters - in this particular case, using CloudFormation. [hands on]

**Nextcloud**

 Nextcloud is an open source platform to store, share and manage files over the web. Following on from a previous post on this project, Helge Aufderheide this time writes, [Advanced Nextcloud Workflows with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2mj) that build on that idea and demonstrate advanced functionalities and optimisations, such as starting workflows when you upload a file and optimising your Amazon S3 usage for cost. [hands on]

### Quick updates

**OpenSearch**

The OpenSearch community survey reports were published last week, and Dr. Aparna Sundar put together a post, [OpenSearch Project Q1 community survey results](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2md), that walked through the highlights. I would encourage you all to check this post out.

Also, have you signed up for the OpenSearch newsletter? Check the latest edition, [OpenSearch Project Newsletter - Volume 1, Issue 2](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2me) and make sure you bookmark/subscribe to keep up to date with the latest OpenSearch news.

**Apache Cassandra**

Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, serverless, highly available, and fully managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces now supports client-side timestamps. Client-side timestamps are Cassandra-compatible timestamps that are persisted for each cell in your table. You can use client-side timestamps for cell level conflict resolution by letting applications determine the order of writes. For example, when multiple applications make updates to the same data or when write operations arrive out of order due to variable network latency, Amazon Keyspaces uses these timestamps to process the writes based on the write timestamps of individual cells within rows. To use client-side timestmaps, use the USING TIMESTAMP clause in your Data Manipulation Language (DML) CQL query. With this launch, you can also use the WRITETIME function to see the timestamp value that is stored for a specific cell on tables using client-side timestamps. 

**Linux**

AWS License Manager extends support for delegated administrator to Linux subscriptions discovery and governance capabilities. Using delegated administrator, your management account can give access to another account in your organisation to track Linux subscriptions on AWS. Delegated administrator gives you the flexibility to separate subscription management from billing and other central management tasks.

You can configure AWS License Manager in your central payer or management account and pick another AWS account as the delegated administrator. Once the delegated administrator account is configured, you can discover Linux subscriptions across Regions and accounts, and perform governance tasks such as viewing CloudWatch metrics or setting up alarms.

**Amazon EMR**

You can now get customer-level metrics when running interactive Spark workloads via managed endpoints. Amazon EMR on EKS enables customers to run open-source big data frameworks such as Apache Spark on Amazon EKS. Amazon EMR on EKS customers can setup and use a managed endpoint (available in preview) to run interactive workloads using integrated development environments (IDEs) such as EMR Studio.

Until now, customers running managed endpoints did not have a mechanism to monitor or visualise kernel-based execution behaviour for them. Without visibility into metrics such as failures, latency or successful launches, customers might experience difficulty troubleshooting and understanding what is happening with a managed endpoint. With this release, customers will be able to monitor, create alarms and better troubleshoot issues in their managed endpoints, by leveraging metrics via Amazon CloudWatch for kernel lifecycle operations such as request counts, request latency, request errors and kernel launch failures.
