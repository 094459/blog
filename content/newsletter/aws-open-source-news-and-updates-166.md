#### Tools

**aws-lambda-env-modeler**

[aws-lambda-env-modeler](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32a) is a Python library from AWS Hero Ran Isenberg designed to simplify the process of managing and validating environment variables in your AWS Lambda functions. It leverages the power of Pydantic models to define the expected structure and types of the environment variables. This library is especially handy for serverless applications where managing configuration via environment variables is a common practice. The project documentation is what you would expect from Ran, amazing and very clear. Check out this repo, read the problem statement and see if this is something that you will find useful in your projects.

**aws-cli-tools**

[aws-cli-tools](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32b)  is a new tool that Efi Merdler-Kravitz has been working, written in Rust that quickly deletes S3 buckets. It's a part of a bigger adventure that he has embarked on - revamping some AWS CLI tools to make things faster with Rust. Check out the top level project,  [https://github.com/aws-cli-tools](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32c) for updates and new tools that he might create. Very nice work Efi, and certainly one that I am going to find very useful.


**iac-devtools-cli-for-cdk**

[iac-devtools-cli-for-cdk](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/30h) is a command line interface tool automates many of the tedious tasks of building, adding to, documenting, and extending AWS CDK applications. It helps you by doing the following: 1/Automates templated build of a basic multi-stack CDK application with integrated security, devops, and pre-formatted documentation, 2/Automates templated build of a starter CDK stack, 3/Automates templated build of a starter CDK construct, and 4/Automates templated build of DevOps tooling for CDK deployment on Github or Gitlab. It is an opinionated tool that integrates Well-Architected principals of cloud native software design by default.

### AWS and Community blog posts

**Community round up**

First up are the community posts that caught my eye, starting off with [Correlating security events across different log sources](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/327) written by Amardeepsingh Siglani, Subhobrata Dey, Jimish Shah, Saurabh Singh, Surya Sashank Nistala, Nate Archer, Nicholas Knize, Prabhakar Sithanandam, Praveen Sameneni, Pallavi Priyadarshini, and Xenia Tupitsyna (might be the biggest collaboration featured in this newsletter, go crew!). In the post they look at how OpenSearch Security Analytics provides an open-source solution for security practitioners that addresses the cost and complexity of running security operations by automating threat detection and threat analysis. 

![opensearch security analytics workflow](https://opensearch.org/assets/media/blog-images/2023-07-13-correlating-security-events/detector-infrastructure.png)

From OpenSearch to Cedar, where Darin McAdams talks a look at Cedar policies and looks at how compressible they are in his post, [How well do Cedar policies compress?](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/328). Darin dives deep and provides some experiments that provide some answers (no spoilers, read the post).

![overview of graph for cedar compression](https://cedarland.blog/usage/compression/compression-ratios.png)

The last post in this roundup is from Jake Page, who writes [Harnessing Komiser and Grafana for Custom Cloud Dashboards](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/329). Komiser is an open-source cloud-agnostic resource manager that integrates with your AWS environments and helps you to build a cloud asset inventory, and helps you break down your cost at the resource level. Jake shows you how you can combine this with Grafana to create very nice looking dashboards.

![overview of komiser on grafana](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6373a295d370a41a1a802e8c/64afbaed342b526eb3f116e7_Screenshot%202023-07-12%20at%2010.51.56.png)

**eksctl**

Whilst most folk will probably still be thinking how do you pronounce this word, (for the record, I am in the e-k-s, control camp) Mike Stefaniak and Mohamed Ahmed have been putting together [Weaveworks and AWS Joining Forces to Maintain Open Source eksctl](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31v) that looks at the work behind this tool, and news of the joint maintainer-ship between Weaveworks and AWS. They cover how the eksctl project has been moved from the Weaveworks GitHub organization to a new top level GitHub organisation https://github.com/eksctl-io, and how that will be jointly maintained by Weaveworks and AWS moving forward.

**Seekable OCI (SOCI)**

A couple of posts this week on this open source project from AWS. Seekable OCI (SOCI), is a technology that enables container runtimes to implement lazy loading the container image to start applications faster without modifying the container images. 

First up we had my colleague Donnie Prakoso put together [AWS Fargate Enables Faster Container Startup using Seekable OCI](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/320) which looks at the announcement that AWS Fargate now supports SOCI, which helps applications deploy and scale out faster by enabling containers to start without waiting to download the entire container image.

![illustration of SOCI](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/07/13/soci-index.png)

Diving deeper into this topic was the theme of the next post, [Under the hood: Lazy Loading Container Images with Seekable OCI and AWS Fargate](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/321) where Olly Pomeroy and Vaibhav Khunger dive deeper into SOCI and how it can index a container image without modifying its contents or requiring a change to existing tools or workflows. Very cool post.

![automating soci in your workflows](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2023/07/18/aws_cfn_soci_index_builder_architecture_diagram.png)

**Apache Airflow**

In the post [Schedule automated operations for your Terraform managed resources on AWS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31q) where Farhan Angullia and Adarsh Janakiraman show you how you can schedule operations of your Terraform resources (in this specific example, they use Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow - MWAA) in your AWS account using mainly Amazon EventBridge Scheduler and AWS CodeBuild. Why would you want to do this? Well this can help save operating costs for resources that does not need to run 24/7, something that I get ask a lot about on how you can do this with MWAA. hands on]

![overview of scheduling terraform resources on aws](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/972a67c48192728a34979d9a35164c1295401b71/2023/07/13/Figure-2-1.png)

### Quick updates

**Powertools for AWS Lambda**

If you missed the [tweets](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31o) from Heitor Lessa last week, Lambda Powertools is now Powertools for AWS Lambda. It is more than just a name change however, so make sure you check out the full thread where Heitor breaks it all down for you. Powertools for AWS Lambda is now an official AWS team, which brings long term sustainability to this open source project loved by many developers, among other things. 

**Amazon EMR on EKS**

Amazon EMR on EKS now supports programmatic execution of Jupyter notebooks when running interactive workloads via managed endpoints. Amazon EMR on EKS enables customers to run open-source big data frameworks such as Apache Spark on Amazon EKS. Amazon EMR on EKS customers can setup and use a managed endpoint (available in preview) to run interactive workloads using integrated development environments (IDEs) such as EMR Studio.  Today, customers use Jupyter notebooks on Amazon EMR on EKS using managed endpoints with the convenience of EMR Studio Workspaces using a web-based interface. With programmatic execution for EMR on EKS managed endpoints, data engineers now have the added flexibility to run jupyter notebooks using scripts, chain multiple notebooks, or use orchestration services such as AWS Step Functions or Apache Airflow to build pipelines and run interactive workloads..

**Karpenter**

Karpenter is a flexible, high-performance Kubernetes node provisioning and management solution that helps improve application availability, operational overhead, and cluster compute utilisation by launching new EC2 instances that are best fit to the scale, scheduling, and resource requirements of the workloads in a cluster. When Karpenter is installed in your cluster, it .it automatically launches EC2 instances to meet applicationsâ€™ compute needs, upgrades them to improve security, and optimizes the instances launched to lower costs. By doing this, Karpenter reduces the scheduling latencies and infrastructure costs of your cluster. With the launch of v0.29.0, Karpenter extends the automated node provisioning support for Windows containers running on EKS.

Find out more about this new capability by reading the post, [Karpenter now supports Windows containers](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31l), where Marcio Morales and Bill Pfeiffer show you how you can scale out/in Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022 using Karpenter. [hands on]

![overvierw of karpenter on windows](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2023/07/13/Karpenter-Scheduling.png)

**Amazon Corretto**

On July 18, 2023 Amazon announced quarterly security and critical updates for Amazon Corretto Long-Term Supported (LTS) and Feature (FR) versions of OpenJDK. Corretto 20.0.2, 17.0.8, 11.0.20, 8u381 are now available for download. Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. Check out the [downloads page](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31j) for more details and download links.

**PostgreSQL**

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition now supports the pgvector extension to store embeddings from machine learning (ML) models in your database and to perform efficient similarity searches. Embeddings are numerical representations (vectors) created from generative AI that capture the semantic meaning of text input into a large language model (LLM). pgvector can store and search embeddings from Amazon Bedrock, Amazon SageMaker, and more.

By using pgvector on Aurora PostgreSQL, you can simply set up, operate, and scale databases for your ML-enabled applications. The pgvector extension allows you to build ML capabilities into your e-commerce, media, health applications, and more to find similar items within a catalog. For example, a streaming service can use pgvector to provide a list of film recommendations similar to the one you just watched. Aurora machine learning enables you to add ML-based predictions to applications via the familiar SQL programming language, so you don't need to learn separate tools or have prior machine learning experience. The pgvector extension is available on Aurora PostgreSQL 15.3, 14.8, 13.11, 12.15 and higher.

If using pgvector is something you are looking at or interested in, make sure you read [Leverage pgvector and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL for Natural Language Processing, Chatbots and Sentiment Analysis](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31n) where Shayon Sanyal walks you through a couple of typical use cases in depth. [hands on]

![overview of langchain using pgvector](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2023/07/13/DBBLOG-3334-image001.png)

**AWS Amplify**

Great to see improvements to the AWS Amplify JavaScript library that were announced last week, specifically reducing the bundle sizes for our Auth, Storage, Notifications, and Analytics categories. We've improved our codebase so that you get leaner bundles, resulting in faster load times and improved performance for your applications. You can benefit from these improvements by installing or updating to version 5.3.4 or beyond of the Amplify JavaScript library. This is the first in a series of enhancements aimed at reducing the bundle size for apps built with AWS Amplify JavaScript. A key focus for upcoming releases of the Amplify JavaScript library is further bundle size reductions and improved tree shaking capabilities. Stay tuned for more updates, as we work towards making AWS Amplify JavaScript the go-to solution for your app development needs.

Abdallah Shaban and Ashish Nanda have put together [AWS Amplify JavaScript Library Announces Leaner Bundles and Faster Load Times](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31k) that show you what these look like with some specific details on what those bundle size improvements are.

**Grafana**

Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed service for Grafana, a popular open-source analytics platform that enables you to query, visualise, and alert on your metrics, logs, and traces. You can now upgrade your existing workspaces from version 8.4 to 9.4. Version 9.4 includes several new features to further enhance your experience in Amazon Managed Grafana, such as: plugin enhancements to support Amazon CloudWatch cross-account querying, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, querying multiple asset properties from AWS IoT Sitewise, query result reuse and async queries for Athena; Prometheus and Loki query builders that make it even easier to create and modify queries for your data sources; and service accounts that provide a secure and efficient way to automate tasks within your Grafana instance. 

**Open Data**

The AWS Open Data Sponsorship Program makes high-value, cloud-optimized datasets publicly available on AWS. A couple of weeks ago we added and updated more data sets, which you can read about in the post [36 new or updated datasets on the Registry of Open Data: AI analysis-ready datasets and more](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31m) where Erin Chu takes you through a quick tour of these thirty-six data sets.

### Videos of the week

**Running Dev Containers with DevPod**

It has been a while since I have reached into the rich repository of the Containers from the Couch, but this video takes a look at DevPod, an open source, un opinionated, client-side tool for running dev containers and managing their lifecycles. DevPod uses a provider model, like Terraform, and allows you to launch dev containers on all the major cloud providers, your local Docker daemon, and Kubernetes. And if there's not already a provider for your infrastructure, you can build one. Lukas Gentele and Rich Burroughs from Loft Labs join Lukonde Mwila from the Couch crew to talk about how DevPod compares to managed offerings like Codespaces and GitPod, and to walk us through a demo of how DevPod works.
