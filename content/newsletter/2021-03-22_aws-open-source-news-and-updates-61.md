Newsletter #61. 

This week we have a lot of love for Apache projects, covering Apache Lucene, Parquet, Airflow, Cassandra and HBase, with a couple of must read posts. On top of that, we have more new open source projects, including a couple of curated lists of essential resources as well as some new open source tools from AWS. Finally, the usual round up of open source posts from the community and AWS, as well as a couple of videos and short updates. But before you dive in, make sure you check out these two posts if you are using Amazon Linux or Ruby...

**Amazon Linux AMI End of Life**

First up an important reminder from Vibhav Agarwal and Cameron Sparr in the post, [Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux AMI End-of-Life](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ba), and on April 15, 2021, the Amazon ECS-optimised Amazon Linux AMI will be ending its standard support phase and will enter a maintenance support phase. The post provides further details as well as guidance on how you can plan remediation actions.

**Ruby**

And on a similar note, a post came out late last week that you should familiarise yourself with if you are a Ruby developer. In this post, [Announcing the end of support for Ruby runtimes 1.9, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 for the AWS SDK For Ruby](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/br), Matt Muller provides a reminder about the end of life for a number of Ruby version SDKs

### Community open source posts

**Apache Lucene**

[Open-source collaboration, or how we finally added merge-on-refresh to Apache Lucene](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/bu) this post from Michael McCandless, PMC member and committer for the Apache Lucene project, is another must read post this week. Apache Lucene is one of the first open source projects I remember getting to know back in the early days of open source, using it to power search for a number of applications I was involved with. Nowadays, you will find it powering other projects such as Elasticsearch, and so it remains as relevant and important as ever. Michael sets the stage and provides a background of Apache Lucene, and some of the work that the project has done over the years and gives you a great insight in what it is like to collaborate in a project such as this.

**Terraform**

[Infracost diff - "git diff" but for cloud costs](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/bj) I shared with you Infracost in #57, a project for those using Terraform that shows cloud cost estimates for Terraform projects. It helps you to quickly see the cost breakdown and compare different options upfront. In this post, Ali Khajeh-Hosseini shares more details on how you might use this project.

**lakeFS**

[Power Amazon EMR Applications with Git-like Operations Using lakeFS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/bk) Itai Admi writes a detailed post that will show you how to use lakeFS with Amazon EMR. lakeFS is an open source project I covered back in #40 that delivers resilience and manageability to object-storage based data lakes. With lakeFS you can build repeatable, atomic and versioned data lake operations - from complex ETL jobs to data science and analytics. In this post, Itai guides you through how configure Spark on EMR to work with lakeFS.

**CloudQuery**

[Running CloudQuery in AWS Lambda](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/bl) CloudQuery is an open source tool that allows you to interact with your cloud infrastructure via queryable SQL or Graphs for easy monitoring, governance and security. In this post, Zach Scholl shows you how to go serverless with CloudQuery, using some of the scheduling capabilities of AWS Lambda to help you run it when you need and using other serverless services such as Amazon Aurora. Nice post.

**AWS CDK**

[AWS CDK â€” Where Imperative Meets Declarative](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/bt) Jimmy Ray with a great post for java developers who want to delve into the world of infrastructure as code on AWS using the AWS Cloud Development Kit. As regular readers will know, I am a big fan of AWS CDK (check events out and put the CDK Day on your diary) and find that most of the examples and walkthroughs cover typescript. I tend to use Python, and there is not as much content out there, so it is great when other languages get the AWS CDK coverage they deserve - this time it is Java. 

### AWS open source posts

**Prometheus**

[Setting up cross-account ingestion into Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/b2) Rodrigue Koffi and Rafael Pereyra follow up from previous posts and show you how to set up central monitoring visibility for cross-account applications with Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus (AMP).

**Apache Parquet**

[Export and analyze Amazon DynamoDB data in an Amazon S3 data lake in Apache Parquet format](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/b5) Mazen Ali and Shiladitya Mandal show how to use the DynamoDB-to-Amazon S3 data export feature, and convert the exported data into Apache Parquet. Apache Parquet is a very popular, high-performant columnar data formatâ€”translates into faster queries and cost savings.

![arch](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2021/03/17/Screen-Shot-2021-03-17-at-12.26.57.png)

**Apache Airflow**

[Move your Apache Airflow connections and variables to AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/b3) John Jackson with a great post that shows you how you can managed your configuration details and variables in a secure way when developing your DAGs in Apache Airflow. John dives in and shows you how to easily move from storing these (variables/connections) in each environment to storing centrally using an alternate secrets backend, specifically AWS Secrets Manager. Given the nature of your workflows will most likely need to connect to external systems, make sure you check out this post out.

![flow](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2021/03/08/jacnjoh_apache_airflow_f1.png)

It can set quotas on both users, and groups consuming several files and disk space resources.

**AWS Copilot**

[Connecting to an interactive shell on your containers running in AWS Fargate using AWS Copilot](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/bb) Nathan Peck takes a look at an exciting new feature that was announced last week, ECS exec and how AWS Copilot makes ECS exec easy to use. AWS Copilot is an open source tool that guides developers through the process of building, releasing, and operating their containerised application, and ECS exec is the ability for users to securely establish a connection and control a remote machine (think of it as docker exec - read more in Massimo's excellent post, [NEW â€“ Using Amazon ECS Exec to access your containers on AWS Fargate and Amazon EC2](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/bq)). Nathan walks you through how you can leverage these capabilities in the latest version of AWS Copilot.

![demo](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2021/03/12/ezgif-5-5fd075e0dd85.gif)

### Quick updates

**Kubernetes**

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) has reduced new cluster creation time by 40%, enabling you to create an EKS cluster in 9 minutes or less, on average.  Reduced cluster creation time means you can now quickly test new features and iterate on your application infrastructure faster than before. This is especially useful if you have adopted continuous integration and continuous deployment mechanisms that require frequent cluster creation thus improving agility for your teams.

**MySQL**

Amazon RDS for MySQL now supports rollback protection for database major version upgrades. For Amazon RDS for MySQL customers upgrading from MySQL 5.7 to MySQL 8.0, Amazon RDS introduced prechecks that identify potential issues before the upgrade begins, including both prechecks from MySQL and prechecks developed by the Amazon RDS team. Rollback protection extends the reliability of major version upgrades for RDS for MySQL instances beyond prechecks, and automatically reverts instances to a running state on MySQL 5.7 when upgrades to MySQL 8.0 cannot be completed. This automatic rollback process helps ensure minimal downtime in the case when upgrade issues occur, and is automatically enabled for all RDS MySQL customers.

**Amazon Corretto 16**

Amazon Corretto 16 is now generally available. This version supports the latest Java feature release JDK 16 and is available on Linux, Windows, and macOS. You can download Corretto 16 from our [GitHub Releases](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/b0).

**AWS Copilot**

AWS Copilot launches v1.4 which now provides more operational capabilities for applications hosted on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). This allows you to directly access a container to troubleshoot and run commands with ECS exec. AWS Copilot also added the ability to deploy applications from a Bitbucket repository and attach Amazon Elastic File Service (EFS) volumes.

You can now access your containers directly from your command-line shell using AWS Copilotâ€™s exec command powered by the ECS exec feature. This lets you safely debug your applications while theyâ€™re running in the cloud. AWS Copilot also supports adding a deployment pipeline to safely deploy resources from Bitbucket repositories, in addition to the existing GitHub and AWS CodeCommit options. You may also quickly connect your application to an existing EFS file system using the new 'storage' field in your application's AWS Copilot manifest.
