## 1st June, 2021 - Instalment #70

Due to it being a bank holiday in the UK, Newsletter #70 is a day later than usual.

Make sure you check out this weeks "Quick Updates" as there are some updates that I know a lot of people will be happy about, and I always share great nuggets that sometimes folk miss. More great projects this week, from iamzero which helps you simplify your identity and access management, PMapper that you will find helpful for identifying risks in your IAM configurations, an AWS CDK construct to help you deploy a VSCode server, Orkestra, a super nice project that lets you create workflows using Lambda functions a la Apache Airflow and many more. You will find blog posts from AWS and the community covering Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, Apache Zeppelin, TensorFlow, Packer, lots of containers goodies and more. Finally, do not forget the events section, which is a great seg-way into the biggest news last week...

**Open@Amazon**

Last week we announced Open@Amazon, a celebration of open source on AWS with a fabulous cast of speakers, a fantastic broad set of topics and the event will be fully live so you can get your chance to interact with the speakers and the broader open source and AWS community. Check out the blog post, [Whatâ€™s up with open source at AWS? Attend Open@Amazon live on Twitch June 16](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/jo) or just register to get a handy calendar invite [HERE](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/jn)

**DevAx connect**

Also, later this week we have a new regular open source series by developers for developers that will be streamed live via Twitch, hosted by the awesome Heitor Lessa. The first Thursday of every month you will be able to join Heitor and invited guests as they take you through a variety of interesting open source topics, projects and more. This week we have Lars Jacobsson, and I am looking forward to it. Check out the events section for more details.

**Please help me improve this newsletter**

Thank you to those who have provided such great feedback already, I am currently reviewing and thinking how to incorporate the suggestions. I would still love to hear from more of you, and I have more AWS credit vouchers as a thank you for taking the time to complete the survey. The first 20 will get an AWS credit voucher for $25, so thank you again. It is only 5 questions, and will probably only take you a minute or two to complete.


### Celebrating open source contributors

The articles posted in this series are only possible thanks to contributors and project maintainers and so I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to build on top of what they have created. 

So thank you to the following open source heroes: Stephan Fitzpatrick, Daniel Burkhardt, Malte Luecken, Mrudhula Balasubramanyan, Imaya Kumar Jagannathan, Joerg Woehrle, Brad Kashani, Carl Youngblood, Danilo Poccia, Christian Weber, Alolita Sharma, Nizar Tyrewalla, Josiah Davis, Yin Song, Anne Hu,  Joshua McKiddy, Olivier Cruchant, Arunprasath Shankar, Mark Roy, Eli Fisher, Luke Kysow, Devarshi Shah, Horace Nelson, Brian Schiller, Mike Apted, Serhii Vasylenko, Ibrahim Cesar, Niko Virtala, Troy Ameigh and Andrew Glenn.

Make sure you find and follow these builders and keep up to date with their open source projects and contributions.

### Latest from open source projects

**orkestra**

[orkestra](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kw) this new open source project from Stephan Fitzpatrick looks very promising, allowing you to create workflow tasks via Lambda functions and then orchestrate these similar to how Apache Airflow works. The documentation says "a seamless way of building observable (scheduled or event-driven) cloud-native workflows. It aims to bring a similar development experience to that of Airflow while leveraging the full power of AWS."

This is a project that is going to get some closer inspection from myself for sure.

![arch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/knowsuchagency/orkestra/main/docs/assets/images/hello_orkestra_sfn.png)

**iamzero**

[iamzero](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kk) is an open source tool that helps simplify your identity and access management on AWS. IAM Zero detects identity and access management issues and automatically suggests least-privilege policies. Check out the [newly formed website](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/km) and business that has started to help customers who want support from this tool, and you can read more about the backstory in this [post from Reddit](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kl). As per the Reddit post:

> The tool is in a similar space to iamlive, policy_sentry, and consoleme (all of which are worth checking out too if you're interested in making AWS security easier) but the main points of difference I see are:
> 
> * iam-zero can run transparently on any or all of your roles just by swapping your AWS SDK import to the iam-zero instrumented version or using the instrumented CLI
> 
> * iam-zero can run continuously as a service (deployed into a isolated AWS account in an organization behind an SSO proxy) and could send notifications through Slack, email etc
> 
> * iam-zero uses TLS to dispatch events and doesn't include any session tokens in the dispatched event (AWS Client Side Monitoring, which iamlive utilises, includes authentication header details in the event - however iamlive is awesome for local policy development)

**PMapper**

[PMapper](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kn) Principal Mapper (PMapper) is a script and library for identifying risks in the configuration of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for an AWS account or an AWS organization. It models the different IAM Users and Roles in an account as a directed graph, which enables checks for privilege escalation and for alternate paths an attacker could take to gain access to a resource or action in AWS. PMapper includes a querying mechanism that uses a local simulation of AWS's authorization behavior. When running a query to determine if a principal has access to a certain action/resource, PMapper also checks if the user or role could access other users or roles that have access to that action/resource. This catches scenarios such as when a user doesn't have permission to read an S3 object, but could launch an EC2 instance that can read the S3 object.

**aurora-serverless-to-s3**

[aurora-serverless-to-s3](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ki) this open source project from Devetry simplifies the automation necessary to export Amazon RDS Aurora Serverless snapshots to S3 for a specific database whenever an automated snapshot is created. The project outlines how it achieves its task, provides clear examples and an AWS CDK app to help easily deploy this project. Brian Schiller has put together a short blog post, [Aurora Serverless DB Export](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kj) that provides some additional context. If you want to see a demo, check this short video

{% youtube lyNGeDg6EII %}

**Image-Flex**

[Image-Flex](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kg) is an open sourced solution from Horace Nelson that provides a robust image resizing service built on AWS Serverless technologies and used to resize, optimise, and cache images on "the edge," on the fly. If you want to know more about how you might use or deploy it, he has helpfully put together a detailed blog post, [An Open Source and Completely Serverless Image Resizing Service in AWS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kh)

![arch](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--HJI5FI4v--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8bhb9if8fn1hesm31bq2.png)

**ecs-anywhere-tutorial**

[ecs-anywhere-tutorial](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ke) last week one of the big announcements was the general availability of [Amazon ECS Anywhere](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kf), and this project/tutorial is intended to walk you through an opinionated demonstration of how ECS Anywhere works. The initial steps will show you how to deploy a (somewhat) sophisticated multi services application in an AWS region as an ECS service running on AWS Fargate. Further in the tutorial, the steps will guide you through how to deploy parts of this application on ECS Anywhere managed instances in a customer managed infrastructure outside of the AWS region. If you saw Massimo's presentation and demo, you will know how nice this was and I am looking forward to dusting off my Raspberry Pi's and trying this out for myself.

![demo](https://github.com/aws-containers/ecs-anywhere-tutorial/raw/master/images/stretched-architecture.png)

**aws-do-docker**

[aws-do-docker](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kd) this project provides a simple pattern for building and deployment of Docker containers to AWS. It can be used "as is" to build and run a sample container, or can be customized and used to build, test, and deploy containerized microservices, jobs, or serverless functions. Containers built using this project can be run locally or on a number of AWS compute environments by a simple change to the configuration files.

![demo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-do-docker/blob/main/docs/img/aws-do-docker-demo.gif?raw=true)

**serverless-rules**

[serverless-rules](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kv) is new project that provides a compilation of rules to validate infrastructure as code template against recommended practices. This currently provides a module for cfn-lint and a plugin for tflint. This is currently in public preview, so if you do try it out please feedback anything you find.

**cdk-vscode-fargate**

[cdk-vscode-fargate](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ko) this was one of my favourite projects that I came across last week, although I have not had a chance to test it out yet. cdk-vscode-fargate is a JSII construct library for AWS CDK from Mike Apted that allows you to deploy Code-server running VS Code remotely, on a AWS Fargate container. The project provides you with a quick how-to guide to get you started, so hopefully something I can try over the weekend. You can find the source code in the GitHub repository [here](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kp)

![arch](https://github.com/mikeapted/cdk-vscode-fargate/blob/main/diagram.png?raw=true)

**mwaa-local-runner**

[mwaa-local-runner](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kc) I shared this project a few weeks ago (#66) but that was for Apache Airflow 1.x, and the project has been quickly updated to align with the launch last week of Apache Airflow version 2.0.2 support in Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). Everything is the same, just now using the latest version.

**S3AssetDeploy**

[S3AssetDeploy](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kb) if you are a Ruby developer then you are going to find this open source tool from Loomly very nice indeed. The folks at Loomly use this to safely package up and deploy their web assets to Amazon S3 that are being served via Cloudfront. This gem is designed to upload and clean unneeded assets from S3 in a safe manner such that older versions or recently removed assets are kept on S3 during the rolling deploy process. It also maintains a version limit and TTL (time-to-live) on assets to avoid deleting recent and outdated versions (up to a limit) or those that have been recently removed. Nice detailed docs and clear examples too.

**amazonlinux-dind**

[amazonlinux-dind](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/kt) this repo from Niko Virtala is an Amazon Linux 2 container image with systemd and Docker Engine, and as Niko said in his tweet:

> I built a #Docker in Docker image that meets the #ECS Agent systemd requirement, so you don't have to â€“ you can find it from all well-stocked container registries and #GitHub
> 

### Tweet of the week

We have not had a Tweet of the week for a while, but last week there were a couple that caught my eye and worth sharing.

**Blender**

This [tweet](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/k3) shared by John Mark, linked to an example of how the AWS open source teams are working with open source projects and foundations to strengthen upstream communities.

**AWS Copilot vs**

This [tweet](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/k4) from Jonathan Matthews asking about using AWS Copilot vs the AWS cli started a great discussion and it was good to hear from the likes of Massimo, Romain and Efe. Massimo shared a [response](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/k5) but make sure you check out the thread.

**AWS CDK**

Henrique Lima had [an ask](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/k6) this week for folks who are using AWS CDK. He is specifically looking for developers interested in checking or automating compliance of infrastructure changes, to provide 30 minutes to complete a survey to help him as he works on a Change Analysis tool for his Master's thesis to do just that.

My favourite part of this blog post is where Danilo writes:

> "In Kinesis Data Analytics Studio, we run the open-source versions of Apache Zeppelin and Apache Flink, and we contribute changes upstream. For example, we have contributed bug fixes for Apache Zeppelin, and we have contributed to AWS connectors for Apache Flink, such as those for Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Data Firehose. Also, we are working with the Apache Flink community to contribute availability improvements, including automatic classification of errors at runtime to understand whether errors are in user code or in application infrastructure."

**Apache Spark**

Bigstream is an AWS ISV Partner and pioneer in the field of hardware and software level acceleration. Brad Kashani, CEO at Bigstream, shares in this post, [Bigstream Provides Big Data Acceleration with Apache Spark and Amazon EMR](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ju) why acceleration has better potential than CPU scaling, the historic challenges organisations have had in implementing accelerators, and how Bigstream are able to address those for a seamless, accelerated Spark experience.

**AWS CDK**

Christian Weber provides another one of his regular monthly updates covering all things AWS CDK related, in his [CDK Corner â€“ May 2021](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/jx). Plenty of highlights, including updates from the recent CDK Day, news on the CDK v2 developer preview, AWS CDK for Go developer preview and a nice list of updated/new constructs you should check out. This is essential reading in my opinion, and hats off to all those listed as having their first PRs merged. Please get in touch, I have an AWS Credit voucher waiting for you..

**TensorFlow**

A couple of posts this week on TensorFlow. The first post covers how to optimise the inference latency of TensorFlow Serving in the post, [How Contentsquare reduced TensorFlow inference latency with TensorFlow Serving on Amazon SageMaker](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/k1). Olivier Cruchant shares how one customer was able to experiment with a number of approaches to find an optimum solution for hosting their inference endpoints.

**Ethereum**

Amazon Managed Blockchain support for managed Ethereum nodes makes it possible to build your own decentralized applications (dapps) without having to worry about maintaining reliable Ethereum nodes for relaying blockchain transactions or querying the state of blockchain data. In this post, [Deploy an Ethereum node on Amazon Managed Blockchain](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/jv) Carl Youngblood walks you through setting up and connecting to an Ethereum node with Managed Blockchain

### Quick updates

**Apache Airflow**

You can now launch Apache Airflow 2.0 environments on Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). Apache Airflow 2.0 is the latest version of the popular open-source tool that helps customers author, schedule, and monitor workflows.

**PostgreSQL**

AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) has expanded functionality by adding support for PostgreSQL version 13 in preview mode. Using AWS DMS, you can now perform live migrations from any AWS DMS supported sources to PostgreSQL 13 databases, and from PostgreSQL 13 databases to any AWS DMS supported targets.

**Apache Kakfa**

Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK) now supports Apache Kafka version 2.7.1 for new and existing clusters. Apache Kafka 2.7.1 includes several bug fixes. For a complete list of fixes, see the Apache Kafka release notes for 2.7.1.

**Apache Cassandra**

A couple of quick updates this week.

First up is news that Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra), a fully managed Apache Cassandraâ€“compatible database service, is now Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) eligible to help you run healthcare workloads more easily. AWS enables covered entities and their business associates subject to HIPAA to use the secure AWS environment to process, maintain, and store protected health information. Now, you can run Cassandra workloads that are subject to HIPAA compliance more easily by using a fully managed and serverless database service. Amazon Keyspaces helps you secure PHI through features such as encryption, audit logging via AWS CloudTrail, and access management through AWS Identity and Access Management.

Following that is news you can manage service quotas for Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra), through the Service Quotas console. Using the Service Quotas console, you can view and manage quotas (formerly referred to as limits) easily and at scale as your AWS workloads grow. For example, you can manage Amazon Keyspaces quotas such as account-level throughput, keyspaces and tables per AWS Region, and concurrent Data Definition Language (DDL) operations. Service Quotas makes requesting quota increases easier: search for a quota, enter your desired value, and submit a quota increase request. You can manage your quotas proactively by configuring Amazon CloudWatch alarms that monitor usage and alert you to approaching quotas.

**Apache Spark 3.1.1**

Amazon EMR 6.3 release version now supports Apache Spark 3.1.1 and provides runtime performance improvements with EMR Runtime for Spark. Amazon EMR 6.3 also supports Apache Hudi 0.7.0, Flink 1.12.1, PrestoDB 0.245.1, PrestoSQL 350, Hue 4.9, JupyterHub 1.2, Oozie 5.2.1 and TensorFlow 2.4.1.

**JetBrains**

The AWS Toolkit for JetBrains now provides developers with convenient IDE functionality to create and manage deployments from their code or image repositories using AWS AppRunner. AWS App Runner that was recently announced  is a new service that makes it easy for customers without any prior containers or infrastructure experience to build, deploy, and run containerised web applications and APIs in just a few clicks.

With new App Runner features in the AWS Toolkit for JetBrains, users of any JetBrains IDE can configure and deploy web services, track deployment status (i.e. view deployment notification logs) and monitor state of deployed services (i.e., services active, running, or paused), all without leaving their IDEs.

**Lustre**

Amazon FSx for Lustre, a service that provides cost-effective, high-performance, scalable file storage for compute workloads, now supports data compression. Data compression enables you to reduce storage consumption of both your file system storage and your file system backups. The data compression feature is designed to deliver high levels of compression without adversely impacting file system performance. Once data compression is enabled, newly written files are automatically compressed by FSx for Lustre before they are written to disk and automatically uncompressed when they are read. In addition to compression, Amazon FSx for Lustre offers a range of storage options to help you reduce costs, including a variety of SSD and HDD storage options, along with an option to store data on unreplicated storage for short-term processing of data.

### Videos of the week

**Observability**

Implementing observability in applications a requirement for achieving Operational Excellence, and a well implemented observability plan allows customers to react to operational events, run workloads effectively and gain insights into their applications. In this video, Imaya Kumar Jagannathan will walk you through how to use Amazon managed open source tools for observability, how to use Amazon Managed Prometheus to monitor the performance of containerised workloads and how Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus and Amazon Managed Service for Grafana work with other AWS services
