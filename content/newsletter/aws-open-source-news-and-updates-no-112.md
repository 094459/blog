Newsletter #112. 

Welcome to this weeks round up of AWS open source news. This weeks new projects features projects such as "aws-dataall" an open source framework for building a data marketplace, "backpack" a set of tools to help you work with the AWS Panorama devices, and we have other projects that help you automate DNS tasks, manage game servers, automate data ingestion, and more.

Topics featured in the weekly blog and technical articles roundup cover Amazon EMR, Grafana, Prometheus, AWS AppSync, Delta Lake, Firecracker, OpenSearch, Istio, Steampipe, LAMP, MQTT, and more. With KubeCon around the corner, check out the Kubernetes content and if you are going, pop along to the AWS booth and say hello. We have a number of the open source team attending, and it will be great to meet some of you.

This weeks videos feature a new open source project that I had not heard about before, that can help you migrate VMs to the cloud, as well as a walk through the Amazon EMR workshop. If you have been meaning to do that, now you have a great companion to work along to. 

We finish with the round up of events. Outside of KubeCon there are plenty of other events happening, so check them out. As always, if you have an event or meet-up you want me to include, drop me a line and I will add it to the list.

**Important end of support announcement**

Nothing lasts for ever they say, and so it is that in this post, 
[Announcing the end of support for Internet Explorer 11 in the AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3)](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1oq) Trivikram Kamat shares that starting October 1, 2022, AWS SDK For JavaScript (v3) will end support for Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) and the browser artefacts published in our npm packages will no longer target ES5.

### Quick updates

**Kotlin**

The developer Preview of the Amplify Android library was announced earlier this week that has been rewritten for Kotlin. This initial release enables Android developers to add cloud-based app features, including Auth, Storage, DataStore, and APIs for their Kotlin-based Android projects. Developers will benefit from Kotlin-based language features like coroutines. This release also includes re-architected Auth (sign-up/sign-in), now completely written in Kotlin, which provides better debuggabilty and visibility into underlying state management. Finally, we have layered the new library on the new AWS SDK for Kotlin that was released as Developer Preview last year. This allows developers to use Amplifyâ€™s use case-centric APIsâ€”like Auth and DataStoreâ€”and access the AWS SDK for Kotlin for a breadth of AWS service APIs.

**Apache Hive**

You can now use Amazon Athena to query views stored in your self-managed Apache Hive metastores. Hive views are defined using the Hive Query Language (HiveQL) which is not fully compatible with Athena's standard SQL. With this new capability, Athena automatically handles HiveQL syntax differences so you can query Hive views without changing your view definitions or maintaining a complex translation layer. 

A view is a logical table created using the results of a query that executes against a physical table each time the view is referenced. Views are commonly used to focus, simplify, and optimise access to underlying data. They can provide users with an isolated subset of curated data, combine disparate tables with optimised JOIN operations, or hide the complexities of data partitioning. With Athenaâ€™s new Hive views support, you can bring these same benefits and use cases that youâ€™ve developed for your Hadoop users directly to your Athena users. Views can be listed and examined from the Athena console to provide your analysts with a more complete picture of your Hive metastore. Views can be queried using the Athena drivers, API, or console and are available in all supported regions.

**NodeJS**

You can now develop AWS Lambda functions using the Node.js 16 runtime. Read the post, [Node.js 16.x runtime now available in AWS Lambda](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1oo) from Dan Fox for the full details.

**OpenSearch**

Charlotte Henkle writes about the upcoming OpenSearch 2.0.0 in the post, [OpenSearch 2.0.0 release candidate is available and ready for testing and feedback](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1oc)

**Delta Lake**

Check out the latest updates in Delta Lake 1.2 in the post, [Delta Lake 1.2 - More Speed, Efficiency and Extensibility Than Ever](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ob). The post outlines and dives deep into some of the new updates, so if you are using Delta Lake, then this is worth while reading.

**Firecracker**

[v1.1.0 of Firecracker](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1oa) was released last week, with plenty of new features added as well as fixes and some changes. One of the key changes was that the Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (MmdsV2) is now Generally Available, and that MmdsV1 is now deprecated and will be removed in Firecracker v2.0.0.

**FreeRTOS**

Introducing an updated and more flexible AWS Device Qualification Program (DQP) for FreeRTOS that aligns with the modular structure of the latest FreeRTOS and Long Term Support (LTS) library releases. The AWS DQP for FreeRTOS allows microcontroller (MCU) vendors to verify their integration of FreeRTOS AWS IoT libraries running on a specific MCU-based development board against AWS's published best practices for AWS IoT Core connectivity, and against tests specified by the qualification program. Previously, to qualify their development boards, MCU vendors had to structure their projects around a fixed directory structure and repository. Now, MCU vendors have the flexibility to include only the FreeRTOS libraries directly relevant to their application, choose the project structure and repository that best use their toolchains, and run tests relevant to their board features. By using AWS IoT Device Tester for FreeRTOS, MCU vendors can run the mandatory tests specified by AWS DQP and validate their FreeRTOS ports. With this program, developers can more confidently enable connectivity for their designs knowing that the FreeRTOS ports have been validated for AWS IoT connectivity, interoperability, updateability, and improved security.
