## May 6th, 2022 - Instalment #111

Newsletter #111. 

Welcome to edition #111 of the AWS open source newsletter, a bit later this week but that was so I could pack in even more great open source content. This week we have another round up of new open source projects from the AWS community that include tools to help you manage your AWS CloudFront distributions, resource providers for CloudFormation for Confluent users, managing Amazon Route53 via the command line, a nice tool for Rust developers working with AWS Lambda, a nice tool to help you find your CIDR address ranges, and many more including some great samples.

If you are looking to catch up on the latest posts, we have topics covering Kubernetes, Ray, Locust, AWS Copilot, AWS SAM, PostgreSQL, Terraform, Smithy, AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, Apache Livy, OpenSearch, and more. This weeks video is perfect for .NET developers and looks at an open source project from AWS that helps you migrate your .NET applications to .NET Core.

Finally, we have the event section, with lots of events happening over the next few weeks. AWS Container Day is happening at the beginning of next week. Check out the details in the Events section below for more details, but this is certainly a must attend event, with great sessions spread out over a number of days. The perfect way to get ready for KubeCon.

### Latest open source projects

#### Community

**cloudfront-manager**

[cloudfront-manager](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1nf) is a new open source tool from AWS Community Builder Harinder Seera that will help you to Invalidate, Enable, Disable and Delete Cloudfront distribution. Also display detail of a distribution. He has put together this blog post, [AWS Cloudfront Manager Utility - How To Guide For Windows](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ng) that helps you get start with this tool.

**aws-cfn-confluentcloud-iam-serviceaccount**

[aws-cfn-confluentcloud-iam-serviceaccount](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ni) is an open source 3rd party CloudFormation resource that users of Confluent should check out. It allows to create a new Service Account into an organization in Confluent Cloud via API. Nice work John!


#### Tools

**aws-ensure-route53**

[aws-ensure-route53](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1nj) is a new open sourced tool from nathants that enables you to easily manage route53 on multiple accounts.

**cargo-lambda**
[cargo-lambda](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1nk) this project provides a Cargo subcommand to help you work with AWS Lambda. The **new** subcommand creates a basic Rust package from a well defined template to help you start writing AWS Lambda functions in Rust. The **build** subcommand compiles AWS Lambda functions natively and produces artifacts which you can then upload to AWS Lambda or use with other echosystem tools, like SAM Cli or the AWS CDK. There are other commands (**watch, invoke, deploy**), so if you are a Rust developer exploring AWS Lambda, this project is for you.

**aws-cidr-finder**

[aws-cidr-finder](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1nl) this project from Cooper Walbrun provides a Python CLI tool for finding unused CIDR blocks in AWS VPCs and outputs them to STDOUT. It is very simple, but can be quite useful for users who manage many subnets across one or more VPCs. Read more in the post from Mathew Duggan, [Quickly find unused CIDR blocks in your AWS VPC](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1nm)

**ec2-spot-interrupter-cli**

[ec2-spot-interrupter-cli](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1nv) this is a neat tool that provides a command line interface to simulate EC2 Spot Instances interruptions using AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS).

**amazon-cloudwatch-retention-period-setter**

[amazon-cloudwatch-retention-period-setter](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1nt) By default, all the logs stored in Amazon CloudWatch log groups are kept indefinitely and their retention period is set to Never Expire which might result in excessive costs. To reduce storage costs, customers should consider changing the default retention period. Changing Amazon CloudWatch log groups retention period manually could be tedious considering that you need to track all the newly created log groups. This repo contains a solution to help you automate that, and links to a detailed walk through of how to configure this.

#### Demos, Samples and Workshops

**aws-global-pubsub-api**

[aws-global-pubsub-api](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1nx) This is an implementation of a multi-region PubSub real-time API based on Serverless/Functionless WebSockets where clients are subscribed to a specific channel and messages are pushed automatically to clients listening/subscribed to the channel in both regions. Connections management, scalability, fan-out and broadcasting are all automatically handled by the regional AppSync APIs.

* [Ogury Uses Open Source Technologies on AWS to Run Low-Latency Machine Learning](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1n8) is a great case study showcasing how Ogury, a Personified Advertising company, is using open source machine learning (ML) on AWS to deliver a planned 300,000 inferences per second under 10-ms latency

![overview of ogury architecture](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2022/03/31/ONNX1.png)

### Quick updates

**PostgreSQL**

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL announces support for PostgreSQL 14 with three levels of cascaded read replicas, 5 replicas per instance, supporting a maximum of up to 155 read replicas per source instance. You can now create Single-AZ or Multi-AZ cascaded read replica DB instances in same region or any one cross region from another read replica instance, enabling you to build a more robust disaster recovery architecture.

Starting with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 14.1 and higher, read intensive workloads such as data analytics can now benefit from up to 155 cascaded read replicas that offer up to 30 times higher read capacity versus previous versions of PostgreSQL, thereby reducing the load on source instance. You can now also pre-create read replicas for your selected disaster recovery target read replica and utilise read scaling immediately after promoting the target. The cascaded read replicas also come with the option to enable automated backup that allows for a quicker promotion of read replica to source instance since only incremental snapshot is required for the promoted read replica.

**AWS SAM**

Now you can use the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) CLI to enable AWS X-Ray tracing in your AWS SAM templates automatically, without manually authoring your AWS SAM templates. This makes it easier to centrally manage AWS X-Ray tracing across your Lambda functions in your serverless application.

The AWS SAM CLI is a developer tool that makes it easier to initialise, build, package, test on local and cloud, and deploy serverless applications. AWS X-Ray helps you analyse and debug your distributed applications, such as those built using a microservices architecture. AWS X-Ray provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your application, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot complex serverless architectures. Enabling tracing through the AWS SAM CLI reduces the complexity of setting up tracing on each of your Lambda functions.

To enable tracing through the AWS SAM CLI, simply add --tracing flag to the sam init command invocation to activate tracing. You can enable tracing across all Lambda functions in your AWS SAM application, or for specific functions. 

### Videos of the week
