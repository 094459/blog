## July 22nd, 2022 - Instalment #121

Welcome to regular and new readers alike, to the AWS open source newsletter episode #121.

Am super excited about this weeks new projects, including a number of AWS CDK related projects so if you are a fan of AWS CDK then make sure you check them all out. We feature projects such as "openrolesanywhere", a proof of concept client for the recently released AWS IAM Roles Anywhere, "amazon-redshift-odbc-driver" an open source ODBC driver for Amazon Redshift, "spot-interruption-simulation" a very handy tool to help you test and simulate spot interuptions for your EC2 workloads, "magento-ecs-cdk" a quick way to deploy a scalable Magento environment, "using-rekognition-to-detect-sounds" a very interesting project that will help you hear sounds from your pictures (yes, you did not read that wrong!), and many other projects to check out.

We have blog posts on content covering OpenSearch, Spring Boot, Kotlin, Kubernetes, Cloudscape, Apache Kafka, Porting Assistant for .NET, Amazon Corretto, Amazon EMR, AWS Lambda Power Tools and more. This weeks featured videos include the kick off of the new AWS BuildOn series, which is an open source special, and we have more events for you to check out and reserve your spot for.

**Feedback**

At Amazon we work backwards from our customers, and one of the ways we do that is collecting data to help us know what is important and what we should focus on. Please could you [complete this simple](https://eventbox.dev/survey/8G7HRWY), anonymous survey. The first 25 will get an AWS $25 credit code.

### Celebrating open source contributors

The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created. 

So thank you to the following open source heroes: Aiden Steel, Bob Tordella, Roy Ra, Rajit Paul, Franck Pachot, Matthew Tan, Philipp Klose, Tim Anderson, Darko MesaroÅ¡, and Jacquie Grindrod

### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.*

#### Tools

**amazon-redshift-odbc-driver**

[amazon-redshift-odbc-driver](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wk) the Amazon Redshift ODBC driver is now open source and available for the user community under the Apache-2.0 license. With this release, customers will gain enhanced visibility to the driver implementation and can contribute to its development. Users can browse the code for the ODBC driver on the relevant AWS GitHub repository, submit driver functionality enhancements through Github pull requests, and report issues for review.

We are also introducing a binary protocol support for Amazon Redshift. With binary protocol enabled, data from the Amazon Redshift cluster is sent to the ODBC driver without being converted to textual format, and is kept in binary format. The binary format provides an average of 30% decrease in data sent over the wire resulting in faster end-to-end query performance for queries returning large result-sets. For example, internal tests have shown end-to-end query times for queries returning over 100 columns and over one million rows have had a 43% speed-up. Binary protocol is enabled by default for all users using the latest ODBC driver, as well as the latest JDBC & Python drivers.

**openrolesanywhere**

[openrolesanywhere](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wm) Aiden Steel has put together and open source proof-of-concept client for the recently released AWS IAM Roles Anywhere. Aiden has put together this blog post, [openrolesanywhere - an IAM Roles Anywhere client](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wn) to accompany this project, so make sure you read it to get the most out of the code.

**spot-interruption-simulation**

[spot-interruption-simulation](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wp) this repository has sample that provides end to end automation of EC2 Spot Interruption simulation with application availability testing during Spot interruption. This tool will be super handy for a number of different use cases, from understanding the behaviour of your applications and the applicability of EC2 Spot instance types, to how you can use this together with the Fault Injection Service (FIS) to test different resilience scenarios.

![architecture of spot interuption](https://github.com/aws-samples/spot-interruption-simulation/blob/main/architecture.png?raw=true)

**cdk-backup-plan**

[cdk-backup-plan](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wt) this repo provides an easy to use reusable CDK construct to create Backup Plans using AWS Backups. It allows to indicate how frequently and what resources to backup.

**aws-cdk-lambda-layer-builder**

[aws-cdk-lambda-layer-builder](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wv) Amazon Lambda functions often require extra modules which can be packaged in an Amazon Lambda Layer. The Layer is then attached to the Lambda to make the packaged module easily usable in the function code. AWS CDK does not have a simple, production ready solution to create a Lambda Layer. This repo is a collection of AWS CDK constructs to build Python Lambda Layers with minimum requirements on the user side, e.g. no bash or zip cli has to be available on the user's machine.

**cdk-testable-infrastructure**

[cdk-testable-infrastructure](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wu) Reliable integration testing gives developers the confidence needed to promote the changes from testing to production environments. But how should you think about implementing tests for your applications? This repo provides some examples of how you can add integration tests to your infrastructure deployment code, and provides a number (three) patterns for you to explore and then think about what might work for you.

### Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops

**magento-ecs-cdk**

[magento-ecs-cdk](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wq) Magento is a very popular open-source e-commerce platform written in PHP. This repository consist of a sample project providing infrastructure as code based on AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) in order to run open-source e-commerce Magento software platform. The CDK application will deploy highly-available and scalable Magento platform by leveraging Amazon Elastic Container Services (Amazon ECS) and several additional AWS services.

![overview of magento on aws ecs architecture](https://github.com/aws-samples/magento-ecs-cdk/blob/main/doc/images/magento-archi.png?raw=true)

**using-rekognition-to-detect-sounds**

[using-rekognition-to-detect-sounds](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wr) this looks like a very interesting sample project. This project demonstrates the use of Rekognition to detect audio events when used in combination with spectrographic analysis. The project has two main aspects: generating training data (spectrograms) from audio samples of background noise and alarms, and an inference pipeline to use the model to detect if a smoke alarm sound is present in an audio file.

**aws-cdk-web-app-example**

[aws-cdk-web-app-example](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ws) This is an example of how to build a resilient web application with just 30 lines lines of TypeScript code by using the AWS CDK. It consists of one Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with private and public subnets in multiple Availability Zones, in which an Application Load Balancer and an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Group are deployed. The Application Load Balancer accepts requests via HTTP (port 80) and forwards them to the instances of the Auto Scaling Group. The Auto Scaling Group is using a Launch Configuration that contains a User Data script to install the Apache HTTP Server and serve a static HTML page.

**amazon-athena-execution-parameters-blog**

[amazon-athena-execution-parameters-blog](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ww) this repo contains everything you need to deploy a sample web application to demonstrate new ability to pass executions parameters to Amazon Athena StartQueryExecution API. This sample application uses a number of AWS services to demonstrate a Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) architecture pattern that uses Amazon Athena to query the Amazon.com customer reviews dataset.

### Quick updates

**AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript**

Last week saw the general availability of AWS Lambda Powertools for TypeScript, an open-source developer library to help you incorporate Well-Architected Serverless best practices into your Lambda function code as early and as fast as possible. In this release, Lambda Powertools for TypeScript focuses on three observability features: distributed tracing (Tracer), structured logging (Logger), and asynchronous business and application metrics (Metrics). Developers can use Lambda Powertools for TypeScript to adopt these practices in mere seconds.

**Amazon Corretto**

This week we announced quarterly security and critical updates for Amazon Corretto Long-Term Supported (LTS) versions of OpenJDK. Corretto 18.0.2, 17.0.4, 11.0.16, 8u342 are now available for download. Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. Check out the [Amazon Corretto July, 2022 quarterly updates](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1wj) for more info and links to the full list of updates.

**Porting Assistant for .NET**

Porting Assistant for .NET is an open source analysis tool that reduces the manual effort and guesswork involved in porting .NET Framework applications to .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, or .NET 6, helping customers move to Linux faster. It identifies incompatibilities, generates an assessment report with known replacement suggestions, and assists with porting.

Porting Assistant for .NET now supports assessment and porting of legacy .NET Framework applications written in VB.NET language. With this release, Porting Assistant will translate VB.NET class libraries, web APIs, and console applications to .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, or .NET 6 to simplify the modernisation of legacy .NET Framework applications written in VB.NET . Developers can use the Porting Assistant for .NET standalone tool or Porting Assistant for .NET Visual Studio IDE extension to modernise their legacy VB.NET applications. Support for VB.NET is added in addition to existing support for assessment and porting of C# based .NET Framework applications.

**Amazon EMR**

Announced last week were a couple of new features that help enforce access controls with Amazon EMR on EC2 clusters (EMR Clusters). These features are supported with jobs that are submitted to the cluster using the EMR Steps API. First is Runtime Role with EMR Steps. A Runtime Role is an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that you associate with an EMR Step. An EMR Step uses this role to access AWS resources. The second is integration with AWS Lake Formation to apply table and column-level access controls for Apache Spark and Apache Hive jobs with EMR Steps.

Previously, all jobs running on an EMR cluster used the IAM role associated with the EMR clusterâs EC2 Instances to access resources. This role is called the EMR EC2 Instance Profile. For example, if a Spark job and Hive job running on the same cluster needed to access different S3 buckets, then the Instance Profile must allow access to both the buckets. With Runtime Role for EMR Steps, you specify a different IAM role for the Spark and the Hive job, thus scoping down access at a job level. This allows you to simplify access controls on a single EMR cluster that is shared between multiple tenants, wherein each tenant is isolated using IAM roles.

In addition, you can use AWS Lake Formation to apply Table and Column-level permissions with Apache Spark and Apache Hive jobs submitted as EMR Steps. AWS Lake Formation is a fully managed service that makes it easy to build, secure, and manage data lakes. AWS Lake Formation enables you to apply fine-grained access control to data stored in data lakes, through a simple grant or revoke mechanism, much like a relational database management system (RDBMS). With this feature, table and column-level permissions defined in AWS Lake Formation for an IAM Role are seamlessly enforced with Apache Hive and Apache Spark jobs submitted as EMR Steps. This allows you to further simplify access controls, and provide each job with access to specific Databases, Tables, and Columns.
