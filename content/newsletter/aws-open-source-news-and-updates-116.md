First up, we have "aws-exec" a tool to help you do adhoc shell execution in AWS Lambda functions, "edgy" helps you simplify writing tests for Node.js based AWS CloudFront Lambda@Edge functions, "cdk-app-cli" a really nice cli that every AWS CDK user should know about, "Accumulus" a great looking reporting tool for AWS Lambda users, "sqldef-gitops-cdk"  is a schema management for several open source databases, "log-hub" helps you to build your own log analytics tool using OpenSearch, "verifiable-controls-evidence-store" a very cool solution that builds a mechanism to centrally store findings and results of cloud security controls governing AWS workloads, and many more! These should keep you all very busy.

On top of that, we feature this week content covering Flutter, MySQL, Open Data, Amazon EMR, CentOS Linux, Rocky Linux, SUSE, PostgreSQL, Redis, Apache Cassandra, Quarkus, GROMACS, AWS ParallelCluster, Open Policy Agent and more, and this weeks videos cover AWS SAM and AWS CDK so make sure you check those out too.

We have events coming up, and I just want to give a plug for my colleagues webinar on the 16th, Machine Learning at scale using Kubeflow with Amazon EKS and Amazon EFS. Very cool demo, so put that in your diary if you are free.

As always, please get in touch if you have any news, projects, events that you would like me to include in this newsletter. I am always looking for the most interesting, unique, novel content to feature, so look forward to hearing from you.


### Celebrating open source contributors

The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created. 

So thank you to the following open source heroes:  Taylan Unal, Rucha Deshpande, Santhan Pamulapati, Sean Smith, Nathants, Peter Mescalchin, Marcia Villalba, Laimonas Sutkus, Hantzley Tauckoor, Calvin Ngo, Vinicius Senger, Sami Imseih, Yahav Biran, Rohit Satyanarayana, Hemalatha Katari, Vadim Lyakhovich, Ram Pathangi, Parth Patel, Ashok Padmanabhan, Bret Pontillo, and Gaurav Gundal.

### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.*

#### Tools

**aws-exec**

[aws-exec](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sd) this project from nathants, enables you to do adhoc shell execution in AWS Lambda functions. Check out the documentation around use cases and how this works, but this looks like it might be pretty handy.

![demo of tool](https://ricsuepublicresources.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/web.gif)

**edgy**

[edgy](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sf) Peter Mescalchin has put together this tool that helps you author tests for Node.js based AWS CloudFront Lambda@Edge functions. Edgy provides four core constructors, which directly relate to each of the four life cycle points available in a CloudFront request. In Peters own words:

> Been doing a bit of work recently with CloudFront using Lambda@Edge functions under Node.js, to the point I really needed some half decent unit tests written - so I've put together an npm package harness to help write those tests.
>
> Package helps craft Lambda@Edge event payloads for the four available request points, execute those payloads against given functions and returns the result to allow for test assertions. Edgy also does its own semi-extensive validation of function results returned to (at some level) validate it would pass as a valid/expected CloudFront response.
> 

If you find this helpful, make sure you let Peter know.

**Accumulus**

[Accumulus](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1se) this project is a web application that provides comprehensive charts for direct comparison of functions while presenting bottlenecks and potential areas for resource allocation adjustments. In the post, Meet Accumulus â€” A Tool to Simplify Your AWS Lambda View, Eric Wu provides more details and shows you how to get started. Looks really nice, so check this one out.

![demo graphs of accumulus](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oslabs-beta/Accumulus/dev/src/public/dashboard.gif)

**cdk-app-cli**

[cdk-app-cli](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sm) this is a new experimental operator CLI for CDK apps. cdk-app lets you associate commands with CDK constructs so that you can quickly invoke functions, redrive queues, visit resources in the AWS console, and more by just referencing the construct name. For example, "cdk-app MyLambda tail-logs" streams logs in real time from the Lambda's log group, or "cdk-app TransactionTable visit-console" opens the AWS console page for your table.

**sqldef-gitops-cdk**

[sqldef-gitops-cdk](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1s8) [sqldef](https://github.com/k0kubun/sqldef) is an open source idempotent schema management for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others. This repo provides a GitOps approach using AWS CDK of how you can approach database table migration.

![architecture of solution](https://github.com/aws-samples/sqldef-gitops-cdk/blob/main/imgs/arch.png?raw=true)

**aws-emr-utilities**

[aws-emr-utilities](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sa) is a repository that contains sample code and utilities for using Amazon EMR on EC2. This package is structured around applications (application specific patches, plugins, etc) and utilities (administrative and maintenance utilities for working with EMR)

**log-hub**

[log-hub](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1s2)  this repo will help you quickly build your own log analytics platform on OpenSearch. Has detailed [documentation](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1s3) including how to get started. Check out the accompanying [log-hub-workshop](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1s9) if this is something you like the look of.

![architecture overview of log-hub](https://awslabs.github.io/log-hub/en/images/architecture/arch.svg)
*[architecture of solution](https://awslabs.github.io/log-hub/en/implementation-guide/architecture/)*

**aws-support-case-activity-notifier**

[aws-support-case-activity-notifier](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1s5) this repo provide a base project that will help you automate your AWS support cases. The repo contains some additional notes as to what you might need to do to productionise this.

![architecture for support case automation](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-support-case-activity-notifier/blob/main/images/01-aws-support-case-activity-notifier-solution-overview.png?raw=true)
 
### Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops

**verifiable-controls-evidence-store**

[verifiable-controls-evidence-store](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sn) this repo provides everything you need to build The Verifiable Controls Evidence Store (Evidence Store). This solution is a mechanism to centrally store findings and results of cloud security controls governing AWS workloads, in the form of enduring evidence records that are safeguarded against tampering. An evidence record is a system (or human) generated digital record of a historical fact, related to one or more target entities, and is issued by an evidence provider. The solution comes with a RESTful interface with CRUD APIs, as well as a web interface for managing evidences and evidence providers' resources. Very nice indeed.

![architecture of solution for verifiable evidence store](https://github.com/aws-solutions/verifiable-controls-evidence-store/blob/main/source/images/solution_architecture_diagram.png?raw=true)


**hive-emr-on-eks**

[hive-emr-on-eks](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sb) this repo contains a number of sample configurations and deployments packaged up as AWS CDK apps that show you how you can use Amazon RDS as your Hive metastore.

### AWS and Community blog posts

**Open Policy Agent**

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that lets you specify policy as code and provides simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your applications. In this post, [Deploying Open Policy Agent (OPA) as a sidecar on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sr) Taylan Unal and Rucha Deshpande show how Open Policy Agent (OPA) can be deployed in a sidecar pattern to provide authorisation decisions for microservices deployed on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). [hands on]

![architecture of opa solution](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2022/05/13/OPA1.png)

**Quarkus**

My colleague Vinicius Senger has put together this excellent post, [Cooking Java with Alexa â€” Ep 1](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sh) which is the first in a series of posts that will share how to create from scratch a Modern Java Application using Quarkus. What I really love about this, as a bonus, Vini is going to share how to put together some nutritious and tasty food (in this case, a Sunomono Salad) for those parts of the walkthrough where you might have to wait.

**Redis**

In the post, [Deploy Amazon ElastiCache for Redis using AWS CDK](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sg) Hantzley Tauckoor and Calvin Ngo show you how you can deploy Amazon ElastiCache for Redis using AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). The post then shows you how you can easily integrate this, using a Python Flask application to demonstrate this. There is a GitHub repository that accompanies the post which you can use as the basis for your own needs. [hands on]

**PostgreSQL**

The post [Reduce read I/O cost of your Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database with range partitioning](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1si) demonstrates how to use PostgreSQL native partitioning to reduce I/O costs and increase read and write throughput with in-place partitioning that requires minimal downtime. Sami Imseih and Yahav Biran demonstrates a production-scale system that partitions a time series table database with over a hundred columns and relationships. The end result? I won't spoil the ending, but a significant cost reduction can be seen, so one to check out. [hands on]

![graphs of postgres optimisation blog post](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2022/05/25/DBBLOG-2158-image009-1.png)

**Apache Cassandra**

If you wanted to know how you could ingest customer data from Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) into SageMaker and train a clustering model, then you are in luck. In the post, [Train machine learning models using Amazon Keyspaces as a data source](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sk), Vadim Lyakhovich, Ram Pathangi, and Parth Patel show you how you can do this, using a specific use case around segmenting customers. [hands on]

**Database Migration Service**

Many customers are using AWS Database Migration service to help them move from proprietary databases to open source ones. In scenarios where you might have strict network controls in place, this might have proven more complex to set up. In this post, [Deploy AWS DMS in a multi-tiered secure network using an Nginx proxy server](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sj), Rohit Satyanarayana and Hemalatha Katari share how you can use the open source web and proxy server Nginx, to help meet your network isolation and security requirements. [hands on]

![architecture of solution](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2022/06/01/DBBLOG-1628-image007.png)

**GROMACS**

GROMACS is a popular open-source software package designed for simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. In this post, [Running cost-effective GROMACS simulations using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances with AWS ParallelCluster](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1sq) Santhan Pamulapati and Sean Smith collaborate to show  how by combining GROMACS features with Spot pricing and scheduling with Slurm (a workload manager/job scheduler), you can architect a cost-effective solution for running GROMACS simulations. In this post they show you how they built a solution with GROMACS installed on AWS ParallelCluster. [hands on]

### Quick updates

**Amazon EMR**

Amazon EMR release 6.6 now supports Apache Spark 3.2, Apache Spark RAPIDS 22.02, CUDA 11, Apache Hudi 0.10.1, Apache Iceberg 0.13, Trino 0.367, and PrestoDB 0.267. You can use the performance-optimized version of Apache Spark 3.2 on EMR on EC2, EKS, and recently released EMR Serverless. In addition Apache Hudi 0.10.1 and Apache Iceberg 0.13 are available on EC2, EKS, and Serverless. Apache Hive 3.1.2 is available on EMR on EC2 and EMR Serverless. Trino 0.367 and PrestoDB 0.267 are only available on EMR on EC2. 

Each Amazon EMR release version uses a default Amazon Linux 2 (AL2) Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Amazon EMR. Prior to Amazon EMR 6.6, the default AMI was based on the latest and up-to-date Amazon Linux AMI available at the time of the Amazon EMR release. Therefore, the Amazon EMR release version was "locked" to its respective assigned AL2 AMI. This means that any new updates to AL2 were not automatically updated, unless you moved to the next Amazon EMR release or manually install them. With Amazon EMR 6.6 and subsequent releases, every time you launch an EMR on EC2 cluster, Amazon EMR automatically uses the latest AL2 release. See our documentation to learn more.

With Amazon EMR release 6.6 and later, applications that use Log4j 1.x and Log4j 2.x will be upgraded to use Log4j 1.2.17 (or higher) and Log4j 2.17.1 (or higher) respectively, and will not require using the bootstrap actions provided above to mitigate the CVE issues.

Further, with Amazon EMR release 6.6, cluster startup time on EMR on EC2 has improved by 80 seconds on average for clusters that use Amazon EMR default AMI option, and install common applications like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Hive.

**MySQL**

Following the announcement of updates in MySQL database versions 5.7 and 8.0, we have updated Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MySQL to support MySQL minor versions 5.7.38, and 8.0.29.

**Flutter**

The Amplify Flutter team is announcing the release of version 0.5.0 of the Amplify Flutter library. Read more about this in the post, [NEW Amplify Flutter Release Notes 0.5.0](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1rx)

In addition to this post, AWS Amplify Flutter has introduced support for creating customisable authentication flows, using Amazon Cognito Lambda triggers. Using this functionality, developers are able to setup customisations for the login experience in their Flutter apps, such as creating OTP login flows, or adding CAPTCHA to their Flutter app.

Developers of Amplify Flutter can setup the Auth category to use custom challenges using the Amplify CLI such as one-time passwords, or Captcha. The Amplify CLI provisions Lambdas in the backend, which then interact with Amazon Cognito to verify the challenges. Developers can build the custom challenges are built in steps, such as providing a one-time password after using an email for login, and a user of the app will have to clear each step in the challenges to get authenticated.

**Steampipe**

Steampipe  is an open source tool where you can use SQL to instantly query your cloud services. Via a collection of "mods" you can do various things, such as compliance checks. NIST 800-53 is a regulatory standard that defines the minimum baseline of security controls for all U.S. federal information systems except those related to national security. A new release, [NIST 800-53 Revision 5](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/1ry) was published last week.


### Videos of the week

**AWS SAM**

You can use the Node.js runtime to run TypeScript code in AWS Lambda. Because Node.js doesn't run TypeScript code natively, you must first transpile your TypeScript code into JavaScript. Then, use the JavaScript files to deploy your function code to Lambda. In this video, Marcia Villalba shows you how to do that using AWS SAM. 

{{< youtube GykEaUKDcrk >}}

**AWS CDK**

Laimonas Sutkus provides the follow up to a previous video I shared, this is part 2 of the AWS CDK "from zero to hero" workshop. In this episode, expect to find out more about writing integration tests, creating GitHub repo and pushing code and creating CI/CD pipelines.
