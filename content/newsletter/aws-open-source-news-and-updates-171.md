## August 29th, 2023 - Instalment #171

Welcome to #171 of the AWS open source newsletter, the newsletter created for developers passionate about open source. Thanks to the wonderful August bank holiday here in the UK, we are publishing a day later than usual. If you have not read this newsletter before, we feature new projects, content from across the open source and AWS community, and share events and videos that you should check out.

This weeks new projects include ways to automate deployments within your AWS environments at scale, a tool to help you run scripts within AWS Lambda, a tool that helps you simplify setting up a CI/CD pipeline full of open source security scanning tools, a Python library for Cedar (as well as a demo app that uses this library), and more! We have content on open source projects this week that include Cedar, Kubernetes, aws-iam-authenticator, LocalStack, AWS SAM, Open Data Maps, AWS CDK, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, Memcached, MySQL, MariaDB, OpenShift, Grafana, Prometheus, and Ratify.

As always, make sure you do not skip the video section or the events section. And as always, if you have an open source event you would like me to share with the readers, just drop me a line.

**Feedback**

Before you dive in however, I need your help!  Please please please take 1 minute to [complete this short survey](https://www.pulse.aws/promotion/10NT4XZQ) and you will forever have my gratitude! 

### Celebrating open source contributors

The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created.

So thank you to the following open source heroes:  Sai Kiran Kshatriya, Cal Heldenbrand, Stephen Kuenzli, Jeremy Cowan, Frank Osasere Idugboe, Lionel Tcham, Allen Helton, Stephanie May, Katie Kowals, Emina Torlak, Jehu Gray, Abiola Olanrewaju, Serge Poueme, Anand Komandooru, Li Liu, Neil Potter, Vivek Shrivastava, Sai Vennam, Imaya Kumar Jagnnathan, Elamaran Shanmugam, and Mikhail Shapirov

### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution. The projects mentioned here do not represent any formal recommendation or endorsement, I am just sharing for greater awareness as I think they look useful and interesting!*

#### Tools

**aws-orga-deployer**

[aws-orga-deployer](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36u) makes it easier to deploy and manage infrastructure-as-code at the scale of an AWS Organizations. It enables to deploy Terraform or CloudFormation templates and to execute Python scripts in multiple AWS accounts and multiple regions, making it particularly suitable for building AWS foundations (or Landing Zones). To get started, you develop modules (Terraform or CloudFormation templates or Python scripts), create a package definition file to specify which modules to deploy in which accounts and regions and using which parameters, and let AWS Orga Deployer deploy modules and manage dependencies between deployments. Check out the nice documentation, which provides an overview of the key concepts and shows you how you can get started.

**lambda_shell**

[lambda_shell](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36s) is a tool from Cal Heldenbrand that provides a Lambda Runtime Interface Client written in pure Bash and Curl. It allows you to quickly create a simple bash script to run in Lambda for use cases like cron jobs or tasks that you want to quickly set up and deploy. This also implements the Lambda Function URL API to to write HTTP endpoints in bash. A very detailed README provides lots of examples that should help you explore and experiment with this project. Be sure to let Cal know what you think, and check out [Cal's post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/15xdknr/new_project_lambda_shell/) for more details.

**simple-code-scanning-pipeline**

[simple-code-scanning-pipeline ](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36p)- The Simple Code Scanning Pipeline project creates a pipeline that AWS users can use to automatically scan a wide variety of code for security and syntax issues. This repo sets up a ready-to-use development environment integrated with a CI pipeline with security and DevOps best practices. Upon successful deployment, it will configure an AWS CodeCommit Git repository (you can specify an existing one if you want), and a multi-stage pipeline  that integrates a number of open source tools such as: Bandit for finding common security issues in Python code, Flake8 for ensuring well-formatted Python code, cfn_nag for CloudFormation template linting and security checks, Checkov for Terraform linting, Gitleaks for secret detection, Shellcheck for Shell script linting, SqlFluff for SQL linting, Unit testing of RDK Custom Config rules, and more. Check out the repo for the full list of tools used.

**cedar-py**

[cedar-py](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36q) is a Python wrapper that helps you use the (Rust) Cedar Policy library from Python. You can use cedarpy to check whether a request is authorised by the Cedar Policy engine, and validate the format of your policies. I cannot recommend this library enough, and is perfect if you are a Python developer looking to lean into the excitement around Cedar. In fact, check out the demo section below where I put this library to use in a very simple Flask demo app. Thank you Stephen, great stuff!

### Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops

**amazon-eks-scaling-with-keda-and-karpenter**

[amazon-eks-scaling-with-keda-and-karpenter](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36t) this repository contains the necessary files and instructions to deploy and configure KEDA (Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling) and Karpenter (Kubernetes Node Autoscaler) on an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. KEDA enables autoscaling of Kubernetes pods based on the number of events in event sources such as Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ, Kafka, and more. Karpenter is a Kubernetes node autoscaler that scales the number of nodes in your cluster based on resource usage. README contains plenty of good documentation as well as a video to help you get started.

![demo of eks scaling with keda and karpenter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-scaling-with-keda-and-karpenter/main/img/Keda.gif)

**cedar-flask-demo**

[cedar-flask-demo](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36r) I have been playing around with [cedar-py](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36q) from Stephen Kuenzli (see above) and put together a very simple Flask based demo showing how you can use it to simplify authorisations within your Flask applications. I hope you will be able to see how easy it is to use, and spark some ideas and perhaps more comprehensive demos from Python developers out there!

### AWS and Community blog posts

**Community round up**

As usual, we begin the round up of written content by exploring the community posts. We start with [Programmatically accessing the EKS cluster API endpoint without a kubeconfig file](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36k), where Jeremy Cowan shares a quick recipe on how you can use the aws-iam-authenticator Go module to programmatically call the Kubernetes API without loading the Kubernetes client SDK. Sticking with Kubernetes, we have AWS Community Builder Frank Osasere Idugboe who has put together a nice introduction, [Understanding the ABCs of Kubernetes](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36l),  for those who are looking for a nice Kubernetes primer. Next we have another AWS Community Builder, Lionel Tchami, who looks at how you can get started with LocalStack, an open source project that helps you mock AWS services locally, in their post [LocalStack: Emulate AWS Services for Local Development & Testing](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36m). AWS Hero Allen Helton's post, [A Beginner's Guide to the Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36n), is the perfect guide for those of you wanting to dip your toes into the world of Serverless Application Model. To close this weeks roundup I have, [Open Data Maps for AWS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36o) where Stephanie May and Katie Kowals provide a super interesting read on the thinking and processes behind creating web maps exclusively from open data, and how to express different purposes as part of its design.

![overview of open data maps for aws](https://stamen.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image2-1.png)

**Cedar**

Emina Torlak has put together essential reading for those of you who want to know more about Cedar, the open source project that provides a domain specific language to help you build next generation authorisation within your applications. In the post, [How we designed Cedar to be intuitive to use, fast, and safe](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36f), Emina shows  how Cedarâ€™s authorisation semantics, data model, and policy syntax work together to make the Cedar language intuitive to use, fast, and safe. This weeks must read post.

**PostgreSQL**

pg_partman is an extension to create and manage both time-based and serial-based table partition sets in your PostgreSQL databases. In the post, [Automate the archive and purge data process for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL using pg_partman, Amazon S3, and AWS Glue](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36j) Anand Komandooru, Li Liu, Neil Potter, and Vivek Shrivastava showcase how to use AWS Glue workflows to automate the archive and restore process in RDS for PostgreSQL database table partitions using this tool and Amazon S3 as archive storage. [hands on]

![overview of pg_partman archiving on RDS PostgreSQL](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2023/08/15/BDB-3508-arch.png)

### Quick updates

**Memcached**

Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached now makes it simpler and faster for you to get started with setting up an ElastiCache for Memcached cluster. The new console experience offers streamlined navigation and minimal settings required to configure a cluster, in just a few clicks. You can now create an ElastiCache for Memcached cluster by selecting from one of the three pre-defined configurations: Production, Dev/Test, and Demo. Each configuration includes default cluster settings based on best practices that are tailored to your use case.

**MySQL**

Amazon Aurora MySQL-Compatible Edition 3 (with MySQL 8.0 compatibility) now supports Percona Xtrabackup for completing physical migrations of your existing MySQL 8.x databases running on Amazon EC2 or outside of AWS. This capability makes it easier and faster to migrate large MySQL databases with complex schemas into Amazon Aurora MySQL. Percona XtraBackup allows you to perform consistent, non-blocking, online backups of your source MySQL database which can then be migrated to Aurora MySQL with minimal downtime. To complete a physical migration, customers need to create a physical backup using the Percona XtraBackup tool. You can then upload the backup files to Amazon S3 and restore them to the target Aurora MySQL 3.x cluster.

**PostgreSQL**

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) for PostgreSQL now supports the latest minor versions PostgreSQL 15.4, 14.9, 13.12, 12.16, and 11.21. We recommend that you upgrade to the latest minor versions to fix known security vulnerabilities in prior versions of PostgreSQL, and to benefit from the bug fixes, performance improvements, and new functionality added by the PostgreSQL community. Please refer to the PostgreSQL community announcement for more details about the release.

With this release, RDS for PostgreSQL adds support for a new extension h3-pg â€” an extension providing hexagonal, hierarchical geospatial indexing system, which allows you to perform spatial analysis to gain insights from large geospatial datasets. Support for PL/Rust and pg_tle now includes PostgreSQL 15.2-R2 and higher, 14.9 and higher, and 13.12 and higher. This release also includes updates for existing extensions: pg_tle is updated to 1.1.1 with support for custom data types, plrust is updated to 1.2.3 with crate support for aes, ctr, and rand, and HypoPG is updated to 1.4.0.

**MariaDB**

Amazon RDS for MariaDB now supports MariaDB major version 10.11, the latest long-term maintenance release from the MariaDB community. Amazon RDS for MariaDB 10.11 includes performance improvements that enable up to 40% higher transaction throughput than prior versions. You can deploy RDS for MariaDB 10.11 on RDS Optimized Read and Optimized Write enabled instance classes for additional performance gains. MariaDB 10.11 major version also includes improvements to authentication, information schema, system versioning, and the InnoDB storage engine made by the MariaDB community. You can leverage Amazon RDS Managed Blue/Green deployments to upgrade your databases to RDS for MariaDB 10.11.

Find out more by reading [Introducing Amazon RDS for MariaDB 10.11 for up to 40% higher transaction throughput](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36b) where Sai Kiran Kshatriya benchmarks Amazon RDS for MariaDB version 10.11 and compares it to version 10.6, and additionally looks at the latest features introduced by the community in MariaDB 10.11.

![benchmark graph of mariadb improvements](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/887309d048beef83ad3eabf2a79a64a389ab1c9f/2023/08/21/DBBLOG-3304-image001.png)

**OpenShift**

In May, Red Hat announced the preview of Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) with hosted control planes (HCP), a new deployment model for ROSA clusters. Today, we are introducing an AWS account configuration workflow for ROSA with HCP on the AWS Management Console. Under the original ROSA deployment model, now called ROSA classic, all AWS infrastructure required to run the ROSA control plane is hosted on your AWS account. Now, you can create ROSA clusters with the control plane hosted and managed on a service account. During the preview, ROSA with HCP clusters will not incur ROSA service fees and should not be used for production workloads.

ROSA with HCP helps reduce the AWS infrastructure cost of running ROSA clusters, as the ROSA control planes are hosted and managed by Red Hat on AWS. The new deployment model reduces the ROSA cluster create time, and you can separately schedule OpenShift version upgrades for the control plane and the worker node machine pools. By moving control plane infrastructure out of your AWS account, ROSA with hosted control planes mitigates the risk that actions taken on your account lead to a degraded ROSA control plane.
