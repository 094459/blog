Newsletter #75.

This week we have a bumper edition, due to the fact I did not publish last week and it looks like everyone has been very busy. We have new open source projects include a light weight Java client, a tool to help you manage your AWS resources and some sample applications to help you get started with location based services, Bottlerocket and algorithmic trading. We have a new workshop on GraphQL as well as the usual round up of community and AWS blog posts, featuring lots of great content for machine and data scientists, container and devops specialists as well as developer tools and IoT. We have posts on Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Spring Boot, AWS Data Wrangler, Bottlerocket, Kubernetes, Drupal, RabbitMQ, Suricata, MySQL, Redis and many more.

I have introduced a [hands on] tag so you can see which posts have code or are walk throughs where you can end up (hopefully) with the same result as the blog post they came from!

**Feedback**

If you read this newsletter, I would love to hear what you think so I can improve it. Please [complete this very short survey](https://eventbox.dev/survey/CHG06PE) (will take you less than 60 seconds) and you may get an AWS $25 credit voucher. Thank you.

### Latest from open source projects

**aws-lightweight-client-java**

[aws-lightweight-client-java](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ps) if you are looking for a really  lightweight java client for the AWS API, then Dave Moten has you covered with this project. This standalone artefact (about 57K) that performs authentication (signing requests with AWS Signature Version 4) and helps you build requests against the AWS API. It includes nice concise builders, a lightweight inbuilt xml parser (to parse responses), and useful convenience methods. Perfect for those situations this is important (Mobile and functions for example)

**serverless-transformers-on-aws-lambda**

[serverless-transformers-on-aws-lambda](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/py) Pratik Bhavsar shared his latest open source project late last week, which looks very interesting. It provides a serverless way to run your machine learning transformers. A [transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)) is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of attention, differentially weighing the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and in computer vision (CV)


**bottlerocket-ecs-updater-cdk**

[bottlerocket-ecs-updater-cdk](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pt) this project from Adam Keller provides an example of a bottlerocket deployment to Amazon ECS with the updater built as a construct. 

**collie-cli**

[collie-cli](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pk) is a new open source project from meshcloud that allows you to manage your AWS resources through a single view. View your tenants, tags, costs, users, access rights and more through a single common model. Check it out.

### Community open source posts

**Apache Airflow**

[Building and Testing a new Apache Airflow Plugin](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/px) Damon Cortesi has put together this great blog post that tells you everything you need to know about contributing an operator to Apache Airflow, sharing his experience during the work he did on a new EMR on EKS plugin to Apache Airflow. Great stuff.

**AWS Data Wrangler**

If you work with data on AWS, then there is a good chance you will find the open source project [AWS Data Wrangler](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pp) something you need to know more about. Not to be confused with SageMaker Data Wrangler, AWS Data Wrangler extends the capabilities of Pandas to AWS by connecting data frames to AWS data-related services. Last week it was included in ThoughtWorks Technology Radar under Trial (to find out more about this, I highly recommend you read about and subscribe to the [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/po))

Check out what they said, but I think this is a great summary:

>We've used AWS Data Wrangler in production and like that it lets you focus on writing transformations without spending too much time on the connectivity to AWS data services.

**AWS Greengrass**

I loved this post from Kyle Neideck, [Cloud-printing for Restaurants with AWS IoT Greengrass](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pj) which really appealed to the inner device hacker/maker in me. In this post Kyle shows you how he build a new open source project that enables restaurants to connect customers to the kitchen. Really well worth reading this project.

![arch](https://miro.medium.com/max/1225/1*H7-sLIPEJpZlWZD9bHn7TQ.png)

**Spring Boot**

[How to Create an AWS ALB and ASG](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/ph) in this post you will learn how you can take your Spring Boot application and then configure a load balancer and an auto scaling group that will allow you to scale up and down your application in response to demand. [hands on]

**KinD**

Amazon EKS-Distro was launched during re:Invent, and is a distribution of Kubernetes that can be run in a number of different environments, including your own. In this post, [Using KinD to run EKS-D](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pg) Jeremy Cowan takes a look at how you can use Kubernetes in Docker (KinD) to run EKS-D clusters on your local machine. [hands on] 

**cdk8s**

Another great post from Vu Dao, this week he writes about using cdk8s (an open-source software development framework for defining Kubernetes applications and reusable abstractions using familiar programming languages - a la AWS CDK), to deploy an AWS Load Balancer for your Kubernetes application in the post [Create AWS Load Balancer Controller Ingress With CDK8S](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pu) 

**Terraform**

If you are a user of Terraform and have wanted to deploy an Amazon EMR cluster that can consume data from other AWS accounts (Cross Account S3 bucket access for example), then you need to read this blog post from Adam McQuistan, [How To Provision AWS EMR Cluster with Cross Account S3 Bucket Access Using Terraform](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pf) [hands on]

I also enjoyed reading another Terraform post from Steve Sklar, [Running Scheduled Jobs in AWS Using Terraform](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pi) where he shows you how you can use Terraform to automate the provisioning of a solution based on AWS Fargate, and outlines why he choose Fargate over a number of other technologies within AWS that allow you to schedule jobs. Nice post. 

**Leapp**

I have featured Leapp in previous newsletter posts, and have it running on my mac when I need to connect to various AWS instances. In this post, [Simplify Aws Developer Security With Leapp](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pe) Sheldon Hull shares his experience in using it so far. [hands on]

**PostgreSQL**

[Install pg_cron on AWS RDS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/pd) Jens Schmidt Hansen has put together this short guide on upgrading your PostgreSQL database on Amazon RDS to support scheduling jobs using pg_cron. pg_cron is a simple cron-based job scheduler for PostgreSQL (9.5 or higher) that runs inside the database as an extension. It uses the same syntax as regular cron, but it allows you to schedule PostgreSQL commands directly from the database.

### Workshops

**GraphQL**

This is a new workshop that will help you get hands on with GraphQL, building a fully functioning application for a fast-paced sports event called the GraphQL Real-time Race.

### Quick updates

**RabbitMQ**

You can now use the consistent hash exchange type on your Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ brokers. This exchange type uses consistent hashing to uniformly distribute messages across queues. Consistent hash exchanges are useful in applications like transaction processing to maintain the order of dependent messages while scaling up the number of consumers.

**AWS ParallelCluster**

AWS ParallelCluster is a fully supported and maintained open source cluster management tool that makes it easy for scientists, researchers, and IT administrators to deploy and manage High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters in the AWS cloud. HPC clusters are collections of tightly coupled compute, storage, and networking resources that enable customers to run large scale scientific and engineering workloads. Significant feature enhancements to this latest release of AWS ParallelCluster 2.11 include:

* Support for Ubuntu 20.04 Operating System - Customers can now choose Ubuntu 20.04 as their base operating system of choice to run their clusters for both x86 and Arm architectures
* FSx for Lustre in isolated subnets - Customers can now set up and mount an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system in AWS ParallelCluster without requiring public internet access. This gives customers an additional option for how they can help keep their HPC environments secure and isolated inside of AWS.

**Bottlerocket**

Announced last week was the General Availability of the Amazon ECS optimised Bottlerocket Amazon Machine Image (AMI). Bottlerocket is an open source Linux-based Operating System (OS) that is purpose-built to run containers. 

Bottlerocket only includes essential software that are required to run containers, helping customers significantly reduce the attack surface and impact of vulnerabilities. Bottlerocketâ€™s root filesystem is read-only, backed by dm-verity. The kernel blocks all direct writes, and behind the scenes will detect any modification as corruption and reboot the host. It also comes with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) policies enabled in enforcing mode for additional isolation. In addition to these security enhancements, updates to Bottlerocket are applied and rolled back in an atomic manner, reducing update complexity and failures.

**Linux**

AWS Client VPN now supports SAML based federated authentication for opening a VPN connection from a Linux Desktop Operating system (Ubuntu 64bit 18.04 and 20.04 LTS). The Linux Desktop client has feature parity with the existing Windows and macOS Desktop clients.

AWS Client VPN allows you to choose from AWS VPN Desktop Client or OpenVPN-based clients, giving your employees the option to use the device of their choice.

AWS Client VPN Desktop Clients are available free of charge, and can be downloaded [here](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/oq).


**Apache Kafka**

AWS Lambda functions that are triggered from self-managed Apache Kafka topics can now access usernames and passwords secured by AWS Secrets Manager using SASL/PLAIN, a simple username/password authentication mechanism that is typically used with TLS for encryption to implement secure authentication. This is in addition to SASL/SCRAM, which is already supported on Lambda. To get started, customers who select Apache Kafka as the event source for their Lambda function can choose SASL/PLAIN as their authentication mechanism, and select their credentials from Secrets Manager on the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI or AWS SDK for Lambda.

**MariaDB**

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for MariaDB now supports MariaDB minor versions 10.2.37, 10.3.28, 10.4.18, and 10.5.9.
