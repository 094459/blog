Newsletter #53

This weeks newsletter has another great variety of posts and projects for you to check out. First up though, and probably the most important news from last week was the announcement around how AWS is looking to keep Elasticsearch and Kibana open source (read the post below). In addition to that news, we have some interesting projects for builders interested in infrastructure as code, a couple of great benchmarking posts, including another great AWS Graviton2 story and my new favourite open source project, Apache Airflow.

Without further ado, lets get going.

### Elasticsearch

[Stepping up for a truly open source Elasticsearch](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2x) Carl Meadows, Jules Graybill, Kyle Davis, and Mehul Shah shared an important announcement for customers and developers working with Elasticsearch. With the recent licensing changes that will, in effect moved Elasticsearch to become a proprietary code base, (SSPL is **not** open source) then this left customers and many in the open source communities with some difficult decisions to make. This post shares how AWS is creating a fork of Elasticsearch and Kibana so that both projects can remain open source, under the Apache 2.0 license. This is a really important post and I urge you to read it. 

If you have any questions or follow up, please do not hesitate to contact me - you can find my contact details in my bio but alternatively leave a comment and I will get back to you.

**Open Data**

We very recently announced eighteen new or updated datasets from Illumina, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, IntelinAir, and others. Whilst not open source, these open data sets are very useful and are available for you to build on for research, education, and product development. Many of the listings for the datasets include applications, demos, tutorials, and publication references showing how you can use the data on AWS.

To find out more details about these new data sets, read the [announcement here](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2m). 

**CloudFormation Guard - RFC**

CloudFormation Guard is a tool that checks #CloudFormation templates for compliance using a simple declarative language. We are asking for feedback on upcoming changes to the rule language through this RFC. Be part of the conversation by submitting your feedback in our open pull request, which you can check out [here](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2s).

### AWS open source posts

**Deep Java Library**

[How Netflix uses Deep Java Library (DJL) for distributed deep learning inference in real-time](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/35) Stanislav Kirdey from Netflix and  Lu Huang, Lai Wei, and Qing Lan from AWS share with you how the observability team at Netflix uses Deep Java Library (DJL), an open source, deep learning toolkit for Java, to deploy transfer learning models in production to perform real-time clustering and analysis of applicationsâ€™ log data. 

One of the ways Netflix is able to sustain a high-quality customer experience is by employing deep learning models in the observability and monitoring space, specifically in observability of system and application logs (not user data) to help improve the customer experience. The Netflix observability team uses deep learning to automatically analyse and cluster gigabytes of log lines coming from various microservices in real-time.

The post provides sample code to help you reproduce the post.

**Apache Airflow**

[Running Airflow on AWS Fargate](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/31) Re Alvarez-Parmar and Chaithanya Maisagoni show you how you can get Apache Airflow up and running on AWS Fargate. A few weeks ago I posted how one of our customers, Affirm has already undertaken this journey and the benefits they have seen. This post takes that one step further and takes a look at the technical and architectural considerations you will need to think about.

![arch](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/fe2ef495a1152561572949784c16bf23abb28057/2021/01/20/img_0416.png)

**Apache Spark**

This week we have a couple of posts on Apache Spark. Kicking this off we have Qing Lan, Carol McDonald, and Kong Zhao collaborating on this tutorial, [Leverage deep learning in Scala with GPU on Spark 3.0](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2u). This post demonstrate how to create a cluster of GPU machines and use Apache Spark with Deep Java Library (DJL) on Amazon EMR to leverage large-scale image classification in Scala. DJL now provides a GPU-based Deep Learning Java package that is designed to work smoothly in Spark.

Following that we have [Run Apache Spark 3.0 workloads 1.7 times faster with Amazon EMR runtime for Apache Spark](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/34). Al MS and Peter Gvozdjak have put together an interesting benchmarking post to help you understand how you can improve the performance of your Apache Spark workloads. They use the [TPC-DS benchmark](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/36) to do this, and as with all benchmarking posts, no spoilers - it is a short post, so check the results out for yourself.

**Apache Hudi**

[Writing to Apache Hudi tables using AWS Glue Custom Connector](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/32) Vishal Pathak follows up from a previous post (which you can find [here](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/38)) taking a look at the volume (or "big") aspect of big data, and how you can use Apache Hudi tables created within the AWS Glue service to process millions of records (in this post they show an example of updating 70 million out of 200 million records). If you like your data big, this post is for you.

**DevSecOps**

[Building end-to-end AWS DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline with open source SCA, SAST and DAST tools](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2v) Srinivas Manepall shows how you can use a number of open source tools such as OWASP Dependency Check, SonarQube, PHPStan and OWASP Zap as part of your automated deployment pipelines to provide security capabilities such as detecting publicly available vulnerabilities in the code, static code analysis, finding common application vulnerabilities and more. This post uses a number of AWS services to help you incorporate these tools, so check it out.

This is a complete solution and the source code is available in the GitHub repository here, at [devsecops-cicd](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/37)

In this post, James walks you through creating a sample application that shows how this integration works.

**Bottlerocket, Calico and eBPF**

[Turbocharging EKS networking with Bottlerocket, Calico, and eBPF](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2z) Mikhail Shapirov and Curtis Rissi from AWS team up with Alex Pollitt, Co-founder and CTO at Tigera take a closer look at the support within Amazon EKS for running Bottlerocket, and what this means to managing the networking requirements you might have. Bottlerocket is an open source Linux distribution built by Amazon to run containers focused on security, operations, and manageability at scale. In this post you will read how Calico can build on top of this foundation to enhance the base networking for EKS beyond just adding network policy support . The benefits of this approach include accelerating network performance, removing the need to run kube-proxy, and preserving client source IP addresses when accessing Kubernetes Services from outside the cluster.

As for all benchmarking posts, no spoilers - read the post. Warning, gratuitous use of graphs!

![graph](https://www.percona.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/saturation_IO.png)

**CDK for Terraform**

[Announcing CDK for Terraform 0.1](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/2r) Anubhav Mishra writes about the release of CDK for Terraform 0.1, covering the enhancements that have been added since the launch last July and outlining how this project is moving closer to beta status.If you are using AWS CDK, HashiCorp's Terraform or just interested in IaC, check this post.

### Quick updates

**OpenTelemetry**

With Amazon CloudWatch agent, you can now use OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs to send application telemetry data to CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray. This update enables the agent to receive OpenTelemetry metrics and traces from applications and services running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and is intended for existing CloudWatch agent users who want to begin monitoring applications with OpenTelemetry without installing or configuring multiple agents.

As a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, OpenTelemetry provides open source APIs and libraries to collect distributed traces and metrics for application monitoring. Instrumenting your applications using the OpenTelemetry SDKs allows you to correlate performance data with underlying infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution. CloudWatch agent allows you to collect metrics and traces and send them to CloudWatch and X-Ray. CloudWatch and X-ray provide tools you can use to view, filter, and gain insights into data to monitor your applications, identify issues, and improve performance.

**PostgreSQL**

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL Supports pg_cron Extension for Scheduling Database Jobs. pg_cron allows you to use cron syntax to schedule PostgreSQL commands directly within your database. You can use pg_cron to schedule tasks such as periodically rolling up data for analytic reports, refreshing materialised views, and scheduling vacuum jobs to reclaim storage. pg_cron includes an AWS open source contribution that adds an audit table so that you can query the outcome of each scheduled job. Amazon RDS supports pg_cron in PostgreSQL versions 12.5 and higher.  

**Apache Kafka**

You can now scale your Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) clusters on demand by changing the size or family of your brokers without reassigning Apache Kafka partitions. Changing the size or family of your brokers gives you the flexibility to adjust your MSK clusterâ€™s compute capacity based on changes in your workloads, without interrupting your cluster I/O. In just a few clicks, you can scale up or scale down your Amazon MSK clustersâ€™ compute capacity that includes CPU, memory, network throughput and I/O capacity. You will be charged for the chosen broker size or family per Amazon MSK standard pricing.

**Apache Cassandra**

Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra), a scalable, highly available, and fully managed Cassandra-compatible database service, now supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) syntax to help you read and write data from other systems more easily. 

JSON is a popular data format used for configuration files, storing the state of applications, and exchanging data between systems. Now, Amazon Keyspaces helps you read and write JSON documents more easily by supporting JSON syntax for INSERT and SELECT operations. When you read and write JSON data, Keyspaces maps the attributes within a JSON document automatically to a target tableâ€™s schema. Using the built-in JSON syntax support in Keyspaces helps you ensure proper formatting of JSON data by validating the structure of JSON documents against a tableâ€™s schema. Storing JSON documents in Keyspaces also helps you query for data across multiple JSON documents efficiently by using Cassandra Query Language (CQL).
