Newsletter #56. 

This week we have the latest update on the Elasticsearch/Kibana fork, events for your diary, the usual round up of blog posts and new open source projects as well as white papers, a nice selection of videos, workshops and case studies. Make sure you read the Rust Foundation blog post this week and check out Didier's post on running a serverless mainframe...well kind of! As always, I am always eager to hear from you about your projects or blogs/solutions you have been working on so please get in touch if you would like me to share your projects here.

**Elasticsearch fork updates**

Kyle Davis has been sharing progress on the Elasticsearch and Kibana forks. In [Feb 10th update](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/6f) and [Feb 12th update](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/6g), shares some great data points with the community including news that the the group is about 93% done with the work. Exciting times and getting closer to a fully open source Elasticsearch and Kibana fork.

**Contributing to open source**

Not related to AWS, this post from Piotr Gaczkowski, [The Definitive Guide to Contributing to Open Source](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/6j) provides some solid guidance and well worth reading if you are both just starting out or a seasoned contributor.

### Quick updates

**Open Telemetry**

News last week that the specification has reached the [1.0.0 specification milesetone](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/6i). Check out the release notes for all the details.

**PartiQL**

DynamoDB local now supports PartiQL (a SQL-compatible query language) so that you can query, insert, update, and delete DynamoDB table data. PartiQL is supported for all DynamoDB data-plane operations, and it helps improve the productivity of developers as they use this familiar, structured query language to perform operations. Developers can use PartiQL to develop applications, and test them offline before deploying them to production.

**MySQL/MariaDB**

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) now supports replication filters for MySQL and MariaDB instances. Replication filters specify which databases and tables are replicated in a read replica. Customers create lists of databases and tables to include or exclude for each replica.  

Replication filtering can reduce the size of read replicas by excluding unnecessary databases or tables, or can benefit security and compliance by excluding databases or tables from a replica. Customers can also use replication filtering to create replicas tailored to specific use cases like analytics or sharding, or to create replicas with different tables or databases in different AWS Regions.

**Serverless Image Handler**

The [Serverless Image Handler solution](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/5t) enables fast and cost-effective image manipulation in the cloud by combining highly available, trusted AWS Services with the open-source imaging processing suite, Sharp. The solution automatically deploys and configures a serverless architecture optimised for dynamic image manipulation. It uses Amazon CloudFront for global content delivery and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for reliable and durable cloud storage at low costs.

This update includes the ability to crop an image as an ellipse, supports images without file extensions, and adds a cache policy and origin request policy in CloudFront to replace the legacy default policies. It also includes several quality-of-life updates, such as improved error handling for cropping and resizing.

**Visual Git support in AWS Cloud9**

AWS Cloud9 now includes visual source control integration for Git (Git panel) built in to Cloud9. Prior to this release Git could only be used on the command line of the integrated Cloud9 terminal. Todayâs release gives you the option to use a visual tool, built in to the IDE, to clone, push, pull, add, and commit files to your Git repositories on Cloud9 environments. Cloud9âs visual Git panel will show you the status of files in your Cloud9 environment and let you selectively stage, add, and commit files to your local or remote repository from within the IDE.

**Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)**

Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra), a scalable, highly available, and fully managed Apache Cassandraâcompatible database service, now helps you automate table creation by supporting point-in-time recovery (PITR) and tag settings in AWS CloudFormation.

With CloudFormation, you can model a collection of related AWS and third-party resources, provision them quickly and consistently, and manage them throughout their lifecycles by treating infrastructure as code. Now, you can use CloudFormation to manage PITR and tag settings for Keyspaces tables. PITR gives you continuous backups of your table data, and you can use it to restore table data to any second in time since PITR was enabled within the preceding 35 days. Tags help you manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. You can create tags to categorise resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. You also can create detailed cost allocation reports based on tags, and you can use tags in your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy conditions to control access to resources.
