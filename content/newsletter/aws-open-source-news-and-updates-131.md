Finally, make sure you check out this weeks videos and review the event listings. Speaking of which, there are a couple of big events around that I want to cover off fist.

**KubeCon**

With KubeCon happening next week, find out what you can expect to see from AWS by checking out this post from Avichal Chum and Phil Estes. In [Top AWS Open Source Talks at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon 2022](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/259) they share what is happening on the AWS booth and the main conference breakout sessions. Also, if you are going, make sure you check out the Event section below - the Open Source After Dark party is running again. We held this at KubeCon Valencia and it was superb, so it is something you do not want to miss. The party is invite only so reserve your spot (link in the Events section below)

**re:Invent**

If you are going to re:Invent, you can now log in and reserve sessions. If you want a handy way to look at all the amazing open source sessions, then check out this [dashboard](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/252) [sign up required]. Would love to hear which ones you are excited about so please let me know in the comments or via Twitter.

**Feedback**

Please let me know how we can improve this newsletter as well as how AWS can better work with open source projects and technologies by completing [this very short survey ](https://eventbox.dev/survey/NUSZ91Z)that will take you probably less than 30 seconds to complete. Thank you so much!

**Celebrating open source contributors**

The articles and projects shared in this newsletter are only possible thanks to the many contributors in open source. I would like to shout out and thank those folks who really do power open source and enable us all to learn and build on top of what they have created. 

So thank you to the following open source heroes: Olly Pomeroy, Praseeda Sathaye, Valentin Widmer, Shardul Srivastava, Deniz ParmaksÄ±z, Allan Chua, Michele Mancioppi, Yvo van Zee, Saravanan Gnanaguru, Ali Alemi, Kurt Tometich, Phil Estes, Avichal Chum, Kurt Tometich, Stewart Smith, Murali Krishna, Jeff Marcinko, Brian Zambrano, Eric Johnson, and Gabriel Soltz.

### Latest open source projects

*The great thing about open source projects is that you can review the source code. If you like the look of these projects, make sure you that take a look at the code, and if it is useful to you, get in touch with the maintainer to provide feedback, suggestions or even submit a contribution.*

#### Tools

**go-kafka-event-source**

[go-kafka-event-source](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25p) is a Go/Kafka client library for developing event sourcing applications. GKES (Go Kafka Event Source) attempts to fill the gaps ub the Go/Kafka library ecosystem. It supplies EOS (Exactly Once Semantics), local state stores and incremental consumer rebalancing to Go Kafka consumer applications, making it a viable alternative to a traditional Kafka Streams application written in Java.

**somod**

[somod](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25d) this project gets its name from Serverless Optimized MODule. SOMOD is a framework to create reusable micro applications using serverless technologies. The framework helps to develop, build and merge multiple micro applications to create a complete solution. The [documentation](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25e) and examples resources provide a selection for you to get started.

**metahub**

[metahub](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25c) is a new open source project from Gabriel Soltz, a command-line utility for AWS Security Hub. MetaHub is a command line utility for AWS Security Hub that lets you work with multiple standards, multiple checks, and thousands of findings in a very simple and advanced way by sorting, aggregating, filtering, and updating your data. In addition, MetaHub adds MetaChecks, an effortless and flexible way to do any tests on top of your resources to improve the level of confidence in your findings.

**terraform-aws-guardduty-multiaccount**

[terraform-aws-guardduty-multiaccount](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25f) is a Terraform module can be used to implement AWS GuardDuty in a multi-account setup. That is designating a GuardDuty delegated admin account and then configuring the rest of GuardDuty in such account.

**project-tools**

[project-tools](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25o) is a neat tool fro the OpenSearch project that helps you create metrics reports on a bunch of things such as Pull Request stats, Contributor Lists, Contributor Stats, Issues and more. If you are looking to automate the reporting of your repo, check this tool out.

**eks-event-watcher**

[eks-event-watcher](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25q) Currently in Amazon EKS, the event TTL is set to 60m. Some customers have shown interest to increase the TTL. (aws/containers-roadmap#785). It will be an additional burden if EKS control plane provided the option to increase TTL as this will add load to ETCD and storage. This solution here tries to bridge the gap to capture events beyond 60 minutes to CloudWatch, if the customers still achieve the same. That way control plane event TTL is not modified but at the sametime, if customer wanted to capture the events beyond 60m, they could achieve the same.

![architecture of eks-event-watcher](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1725781/184262584-24302dee-2bf6-409e-9de5-c48a5578661c.jpg)

### Demos, Samples, Solutions and Workshops

**listmonk-based-edm-solution**

[listmonk-based-edm-solution](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25k) helps you deploy listmonk on AWS. [listmonk](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25l) is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. It looks pretty nice, and this solution uses Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) as an email sending platform and integrates a simple and clear operation interface. Users do not need to know about functions of Amazon Web Services. All deployments and installations can be completed with one click, and they can enjoy 62,000 free emails per month on Amazon SES. The solution can easily manage mailing lists, subscribers, email templates, campaigns, and features statistics and multilingual support to help users achieve business success.

**land-rdbms-to-data-lake-at-scale**

[land-rdbms-to-data-lake-at-scale](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25g) provide some sample code to help you build your data lake on AWS. When you look to build a data lake on AWS, a common data ingestion pattern is to use AWS Glue to perform extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs from relational databases to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). A project often involves extracting hundreds of tables from source databases to the data lake raw layer. To walk you through the code, check out the accompanying blog post, [Land data from databases to a data lake at scale using AWS Glue blueprints](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25h)

![architecture diagram for land-rdbms](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2022/10/03/BDB1902.jpg)

**aws-glue-cdk-cicd**

[aws-glue-cdk-cicd](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25i) this repository demonstrates building a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline to provision AWS Glue based data pipelines using AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK).

The AWS CDK based solution deploys a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodePipeline, executes docker based PyTests and deploys a data pipeline using AWS Glue. The data pipeline consists of AWS Glue Workflow, Triggers, Jobs and Crawlers. The data pipeline uses COVID-19 Harmonized Data managed by Talend / Stitch to construct a data pipeline.

### AWS and Community blog posts

**zstd**

[Zstandard](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25n), or [zstd](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25n) as short version, is a fast lossless compression algorithm, targeting real-time compression scenarios at zlib-level and better compression ratios. In this post, [Reducing AWS Fargate Startup Times with zstd Compressed Container Images](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25m) Olly Pomeroy how to use zstd-compressed container images to reduce the time taken to start containerised workloads running on AWS Fargate. Very cool post indeed. [hands on]

**Apache Iceberg**

Apache Iceberg is an open source high-performance format for huge analytic tables. Iceberg brings the reliability and simplicity of SQL tables to big data. In this case study, [Apache Iceberg Reduced Our Amazon S3 Cost by 90%](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/254), Deniz ParmaksÄ±z shares just why you should starting looking at open source technologies such as Apache Iceberg to enable more cost effective data analytics solutions (as well as providing other features too). This is a great primer post for those wanting to know more.

![overview of apache iceberg](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*QP0D_ZRv_B0HmnIXt7PMeA.png)

**Apache Kafka**

In the post, [Split your monolithic Apache Kafka clusters using Amazon MSK Serverless](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/258) Ali Alemi looks at how splitting Apache Kafka clusters helps improve the security, performance, scalability, and reliability of your overall data streaming services and applications.

![apache kafka splitting mono](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/b6692ea5df920cad691c20319a6fffd7a4a766b8/2022/10/03/bdb-2557-write-read-clusters.png)

**Tekton**

Canary deployment is a deployment strategy that releases a new software version in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users. Praseeda Sathaye and Valentin Widmer have collaborated on this post, [Canary Testing with AWS App Mesh and Tekton](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25j) where they show you a preview of the talk they will be giving at KubeCon, and provide a hands on guide on how you can automate changes and use popular open source tools such as Tekton and Helm to create some abstractions. [hands on]

![image of tekton canary deployment](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/ca3512f4dfa95a03169c5a670a4c91a19b3077b4/2022/10/06/app-mesh-solution-design-1024x628.png)

**AWS SAM**

We have a couple of posts this week covering AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM).

First up we have Kurt Tometich who writes about AWS SAM Connector in hist post, [Simplifying serverless permissions with AWS SAM Connectors](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25a). AWS SAW Connector simplifies permission management between serverless components and this post explores how you can speed up serverless development while maintaining secure best practices using AWS SAM Connector. [hands on]

![overview of components in aws sam connector](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2022/10/12/Screen-Shot-2022-10-12-at-10.26.26-AM.png)

Following that we have Allan Chua who writes, [An Opinionated View of AWS SAM Connectors](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/253) where he provides his take on AWS SAM Connectors, constructs designed to reduce the complexity of authoring IAM permissions that adhere to the least privilege principles. He provides some in depth examples and wants to know if you are using AWS SAM Connectors, for your feedback.

**Open Telemetry**

Normally I feature blog posts, but in a break from tradition, I stumbled upon this excellent presentation, [Open Telemetry on AWS](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/250) from Michele Mancioppi from Lumigo after reading the always excellent weekly Observability newsletter, [o11y.news](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/24z) from Michael Hausenblas (make sure you subscribe, the content is always excellent).

**AWS Community Builder round-up**

Here are some posts from rhe AWS Heroes and Community Builders communities I though were well worth highlighting this week.

* [Scaling in EKS with Karpenter - Part 1](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/255) Shardul Srivastava walks you through an overview of what Karpenter is and how it is different to other things you might have used, and then shows you with a hands on example setting this up. If you are looking to test this out, why not take a look at this post [hands on]
* [Securing CDK pipelines in an enterprise organization](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/256) Yvo van Zee blogs about a presentation given at the AWS Community Day in the Netherlands, so if you missed it, then make sure you read this post on what to look out for when using and deploying using AWS CDK
* [Introduction to Kubectl CLI Plugins ctx and ns](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/257) Saravanan Gnanaguru provides his insights into what and how to use plugins when using the kubectl tool for managing Kubernetes. A quick read that summarises things nicely, and looks at two specific plugins [hands on]

**Other posts and quick reads**

* [Developing a Remote Job Monitoring Application at the edge using AWS IoT Greengrass](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25b) a two part, hands on post that shows a UI application at the edge, jointly developed by AWS Professional Services and AWS Partner, TensorIoT, for remote industrial job monitoring and processing [hands on] 

### Quick updates

**Bottlerocket**

[Bottlerocket v1.10.0](https://aws-oss.beachgeek.co.uk/25r) was released this week. Check out the release notes to review all the OS, Orchestrator, Build, Documentation and Platform changes.

**Amazon EMR**

Last week it was announced that you can now monitor and debug jobs in EMR Serverless using native Apache Spark & Hive Tez UIs. The Apache Spark & Hive Tez UIs present visual interfaces with detailed information about your running and completed jobs. You can dive into job-specific metrics and information about event timelines, stages, tasks, and executors for each job.

After you submit a job to an EMR Serverless application, you can view the real-time Spark UI or the Hive Tez UI for the running job from the EMR Studio console or request a secure URL using the GetDashboardForJobRun API. For completed jobs, you can view the Spark History Server or the Persistent Hive Tez UI from the EMR Studio Console.

**PostgreSQL**

The AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL is now generally available for use with your Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-compatible edition database clusters. This wrapper driver is designed to work with the PostgreSQL community driver and provide improved failover handling for clustered databases such as Aurora PostgreSQL. The AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL is drop-in compatible with your existing applications because it adds failover functionality alongside the community driver, reducing the need for you to make application changes. This release replaces the standalone AWS JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL previously released as a preview.

The wrapper driver minimizes failover time by monitoring database cluster status and caching the clusterâs topology. The cache is then used to improve DNS name resolution speed if a node fails, reducing failover time from minutes to seconds. It is an open-source project that uses the Apache License v2 and can be installed using Maven, Gradle, or by .jar file.

**AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)**

Serverless application developers can now use the new AWS::Serverless::Connector resource available in AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) to simplify granting the appropriate level of access to the resources in their applicationâs infrastructure. With AWS::Serverless::Connector resources, developers describe how data and events need to flow between two resources and the type of access required. AWS SAM will compose purpose-built AWS Identity and Access Management (AWS IAM) policies in order to facilitate the interaction defined by the developer in the connector resource.

By using the AWS::Serverless::Connector resource, serverless application developers can quickly compose or update well-scoped IAM policies to their application, speeding up application development while reducing the IAM expertise required. The AWS::Serverless::Connector resource will transform into purpose-built IAM policies, using Read or Write permissions specified by the developer to compose the IAM policies from pre-defined sets of policy actions. Customers can use their existing policy review processes by reviewing a AWS CloudFormation change set or processed CloudFormation template prior to deployment.
